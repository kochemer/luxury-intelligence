# Podcast Background Music

Place your royalty-free background music track here.

**File:** `podcast-theme.mp3`

**Requirements:**
- Format: MP3
- Style: Calm, modern, editorial (no lyrics, no heavy beats)
- Volume: Should be mixed at ~12% relative to voice
- Duration: Can be looped if shorter than podcast segments

**Usage:**
The podcast generation script will automatically:
- Mix music with intro (cold open + intro)
- Mix music with outro (closing)
- Apply fade-in (1.2s) and fade-out (1.8s)
- Keep music volume subtle (~12%) so voice remains dominant

**Note:** If this file doesn't exist, the script will skip music mixing and generate voice-only audio.
