This means AI will increase economic growth at an average of 1.7% across 16 industries by this period. These numbers show a straight 59% increase in retail profits alone! For this, advanced analytics are used to design and develop models. These models are then used to fetch possible outcomes from a wide spectrum of data given to a computer to analyze. From these outcomes, future decisions and actions are fed to the system which learns it. The system can now perform without human intervention! It can make decisions in real-time. Machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing are a few examples of AI. Marketing, pricing, logistics, risk management, store management, fraud detection are some inevitable areas where the largest retailers have used AI for decades now!! AI – How it uses advanced analytics to solve a wide spectrum of retail problems Manufacturers, Logistics companies, and suppliers are the major industries that support retail sales.

Online retailers use chatbots and product suggestions, while stores can enjoy real-time, targeted marketing messages. Retailers have the need to generate chunks of data on a daily basis. With predictive analytics, this data can predict trends and thus reduce the chance of failures by determining necessary changes to improve profitability. Thus the employees can have proper information faster and deliver more consistent results! Related Reading: AI and Robotics carry the power to enhance customer experience. Here’s a CTO Guide to it. Solving Retail Problems With AI – Steps to Overcome Challenges And Improve Efficiency To Boost Sales All retail companies (physical and online), face four fundamental challenges. These can be solved with predictive analytics and an effective data production plan. They include: Siloed and Static Customer Views Retailers can adopt a complete, real-time strategy by combining traditional data sources with the non-traditional like social media or other external data sources to create valuable insight, resulting in robust fraud detection systems, more effective marketing campaigns, more accurate and targeted churn prediction, and better customer service. This helps them encounter the problems faced by siloed data, where transaction data are separated from web pages, which is again separate from CRM data. Time Consuming Vendor and Supply Chain Management Retailers can adopt real-time analytics and unstructured data sets to combine structured and unstructured data to create more accurate forecasts or automatic reordering, resulting in optimized pricing strategies and more efficient inventory management. Analysis Based on Historical Data Retailers can use prediction and machine learning in real time to create predictions based on current behaviors and trends. This helps them predict the client’s next move. Thus AI helps to adapt automatically to customer behaviors. Single-Time Data Projects It is high time retailers turned towards automated and scalable data workflows. This helps them improve their overall efficiency.
