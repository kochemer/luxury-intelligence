Global conflicts, unforeseen events, and other uncontrollable factors often cause disruptions in the supply chain, making it challenging – and time-consuming – for brands to stay agile and make good decisions. However, the rise of machine learning (or “ML”) technology presents new opportunities for supply chain managers. These new programs are already making it easier for businesses to make accurate predictions and inform their supply chain planning, and will only get more sophisticated over time. In this post, we’ll dive deeper into the use of machine learning in supply chain logistics, explore how machine learning can benefit supply chains, and share tips for how it can improve your supply chain management. What is machine learning in supply chain logistics? Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) technology that uses data and algorithms to identify patterns and make informed decisions. In supply chain logistics, machine learning technology collects large amounts of data from across various supply chain processes. It then analyzes this data to make smart predictions and suggestions for supply chain optimization. Machine learning programs can be used to gather advanced supply chain analytics so you can easily get actionable insights on performance. Machine learning also enables supply chain automation to a significant extent, allowing you to automate things like demand forecasting and route optimization. As such, machine learning is vital for enhancing supply chain efficiency, saving time, and improving your overall performance. The evolution of machine learning in logistics The logistics industry once largely relied on paper-based systems that involved a lot of manual tracking and required implicit, learned knowledge to make effective decisions. When the first enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems were introduced in the late 1980s, they helped streamline and simplify supply chain logistics management. These ERP systems helped to centralize supply chain processes into a single software. However, they weren’t equipped to process vast amounts of data in real time or make decisions that considered all the intricacies of supply chain dynamics. This often led to incomplete insights and inaccurate predictions, which resulted in sub-optimal supply chain decisions. Flash-forward to present day, and businesses can now access technology that’s capable of collecting and analyzing vast amounts of data in real time from across various supply chain processes. The development of advanced machine learning algorithms that perform predictive analytics now help brands make real-time decisions using this data, making it possible for ecommerce businesses to improve supply chain efficiency and oversee their supply chain operations with minimal human oversight. Modern supply chain technology also leverages machine learning to help automate various activities. This includes IoT devices and robotics that leverage machine learning to automate tasks like warehouse monitoring, picking, packing, and inventory tracking. Key benefits of machine learning for supply chains With its ability to analyze massive data sets in real time and speed up decision-making, machine learning can be highly beneficial for supply chains. Let’s break down some of these key machine learning benefits that are applicable to supply chain operations. Predictive accuracy Machine learning algorithms are capable of analyzing huge volumes of historical data as well as current order data to identify demand patterns. You can use this capability to get accurate predictions about future demand. This streamlines your demand planning efforts, enabling you to plan for production and procurement so as to avoid stockouts and overstocking. With better predictive accuracy, you can optimize your supply chain planning to effectively meet customer demand. You’ll be able to plan ahead based on predicted customer demand, transit times, and production lead times. Decision-making With their ability to perform real-time data analysis, ML algorithms help take the guesswork out of major supply chain decisions and facilitate better decision-making. Because machine learning algorithms are capable of constantly learning based on new data, ensuring to provide the most updated and relevant insights, businesses can use them to make data-driven decisions on which suppliers to use, how much stock to order and when, how to arrange and distribute inventory, which picking strategies to use, and more. Machine learning can even inform decisions about optimal delivery routes so businesses can improve delivery management and enhance customer satisfaction. Cost efficiency Machine lea",
