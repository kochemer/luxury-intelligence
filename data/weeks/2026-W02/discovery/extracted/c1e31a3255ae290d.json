But most are still in the early stages of scaling AI and capturing enterprise-level value.\n\n## Key findings\n\n1. *Most organizations are still in the experimentation or piloting phase:* Nearly two-thirds of respondents say their organizations have not yet begun scaling AI across the enterprise.\n2. *High curiosity in AI agents:* Sixty-two percent of survey respondents say their organizations are at least experimenting with AI agents.\n3. *Positive leading indicators on impact of AI:* Respondents report use-case-level cost and revenue benefits, and 64 percent say that AI is enabling their innovation. However, just 39 percent report EBIT impact at the enterprise level.\n4. *High performers use AI to drive growth, innovation, and cost:* Eighty percent of respondents say their companies set efficiency as an objective of their AI initiatives, but the companies seeing the most value from AI often set growth or innovation as additional objectives.\n5. *Redesigning workflows is a key success factor:* Half of those AI high performers intend to use AI to transform their businesses, and most are redesigning workflows.\n6. *Differing perspectives on employment impact:* Respondents vary in their expectations of AI’s impact on the overall workforce size of their organizations in the coming year: 32 percent expect decreases, 43 percent no change, and 13 percent increases.\n\n---\n\nByline\n\n## About the authors\n\nThis article is a collaborative effort by [Alex Singla](https://www.mckinsey.com/our-people/alex-singla), [Alexander Sukharevsky](https://www.mckinsey.com/our-people/alexander-sukharevsky), [Bryce Hall](https://www.mckinsey.com/our-people/bryce-hall), [Lareina Yee](https://www.mckinsey.com/our-people/lareina-yee), and [Michael Chui](https://www.mckinsey.com/our-people/michael-chui), with Tara Balakrishnan, representing views from QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey.\n\n**Three years since the introduction of gen AI tools** triggered a new era of artificial intelligence, nearly nine out of ten survey respondents say their organizations are regularly using AI—but the pace of progress remains uneven. While AI tools are now commonplace, most organizations have not yet embedded them deeply enough into their workflows and processes to realize material enterprise-level benefits. The latest McKinsey Global Survey on the state of AI reveals a landscape defined by both wider use—including growing proliferation of agentic AI—and stubborn growing pains, with the transition from pilots to scaled impact remaining a work in progress at most organizations.\n\n## AI use continues to broaden but remains primarily in pilot phases\n\nOur latest survey shows a larger share of respondents reporting AI use by their organizations, though most have yet to scale the technologies. The share of respondents saying their organizations are using AI in at least one business function has increased since our research last year: 88 percent report regular AI use in at least one business function, compared with 78 percent a year ago. But at the enterprise level, the majority are still in the experimenting or piloting stages (Exhibit 1), with approximately one-third reporting that their companies have begun to scale their AI programs.\n\nExhibit 1\n\nWe strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website.

Twenty-three percent of respondents report their organizations are scaling an agentic AI system somewhere in their enterprises (that is, expanding the deployment and adoption of the technology within a least one business function), and an additional 39 percent say they have begun experimenting with AI agents. But use of agents is not yet widespread: Most of those who are scaling agents say they’re only doing so in one or two functions. In any given business function, no more than 10 percent of respondents say their organizations are scaling AI agents (Exhibit 2).\n\nExhibit 2\n\nWe strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website.
