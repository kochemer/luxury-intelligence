Various forms of personalization are used in many industries for numerous purposes: starting from marketing through streaming services to eCommerce. The main role of personalization in an online store in the year 2021 is to boost sales and improve the user experience (UX). It also works as a great way to engage undecided customers, reduce the number of abandoned shopping carts or increase the number of transactions among first-time store visitors. In other words - a modern store is a personalized store. Personalization vs Customization At the very beginning, we need to distinguish between two terms: personalization and customization. In Polish, both terms are translated as the personalization, although the basic principle behind these solutions is completely different. Customization - the user is able to individually choose the options, which have been designed to provide a more personal shopping experience. For example, users who visit the store's website for the first time may be asked what category of products they are interested in so that the offer may be adopted to their individual choices. Personalization - The system decides what content or offers are displayed on the page. The selection of the message is made automatically, based on the history of the user's behavior. This is possible thanks to artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technology, which, together with the information collected about purchasing preferences from previous sessions, is able to select personalized content in real time. In this article, we will focus on the latter solution, i.e. personalization AI/ML.Real-time personalization of eCommerce sites Increasing number of online stores pay more attention to building a good user experience (UX) on the website. A properly tailored offer is a quick way to finalize the transaction, so it is recommended to make sure that the shopping path is personalized at every stage.eCommerce personalization is precisely the process of providing a unique experience in an online store thanks to dynamic content, product recommendations and special offers generated on the basis of behavior, purchase history and other data referred to below. According to a study by Bloomreach, online stores see about 20% increase in sales after the introduction of personalized content. At the same time, as many as 80% of customers are more likely to make purchases in an online store that uses some form of personalization, and 77% of consumers would recommend a brand that provides a personalized shopping experience. It is also an efficient way to build and maintain a long-lasting relationship with customers - according to the same study, as many as 44% of consumers declare that after shopping in a store where personalization is applied, they are more likely to become regular customers.How AI / ML technology supports online store personalization The introduction of personalization based on AI / ML technology may seem like a complicated process that requires the involvement of IT specialists and a high-cost investment. You might think that this is an option reserved exclusively for the largest online stores. Nothing could be more wrong! Effective and easy-to-install solutions are appearing on the market, available for every store with equally advanced online shopping personalization options. If you are wondering how it is possible that when a 45-year-old woman visits a clothing store, she sees different content and an offer on the homepage than a 25-year-old man visiting the same store? It is the real-time personalization that is responsible for this.It is possible thanks to the information collected by cookies.
