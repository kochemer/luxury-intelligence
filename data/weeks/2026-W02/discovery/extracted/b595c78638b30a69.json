Of course, the unacknowledged truth about shopping is that whenever you go to a store, most products you see aren’t actually the ones you want. No matter which store you’re shopping in, you’ll likely need to sift through a ton of irrelevant items before you find what you really need.\n\nThat’s just what shopping has always been about. But that’s not how it should be.\n\nWhat if the first products you saw were exactly the products you needed? Even better, what if all the merchandise in the whole store was displayed and ordered according to how much it mattered to you?\n\nThat’s exactly what shopping should be — fast, simple, and personalized. A few years ago, that may have seemed impossible, but shopping is now rapidly evolving, both in the store and online. With the power of artificial intelligence ([AI](https://www.salesforce.com/artificial-intelligence/)), automation, [ecommerce platforms](https://www.salesforce.com/marketing/personalization/guide/), and [marketing personalization](https://www.salesforce.com/commerce/), brands are finally able to tailor shopping experiences to customers’ interests, based on real-time web browsing habits and shopping data.\n\nPersonalization allows you to turn every shopping interaction into a meaningful and rewarding experience. In fact, personalized shopping experiences are key to customer [engagement](https://www.salesforce.com/service/digital-customer-engagement-platform/what-is-customer-engagement/), retention, and loyalty in today’s retail landscape. It’s also linked to [higher conversion rates](https://www.salesforce.com/form/commerce/power-of-personalized-shopping/?d=pb) and product sales, as AI creates seamless experiences that leave shoppers satisfied that they’ve made the right purchase, time and time again.\n\n![Image 10: Illustrated cover of the Salesforce State of Commerce report, contains a person with brown hair holding a tablet device.](https://wp.sfdcdigital.com/en-us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/02/soc-resource-card-image-1200x675-1.png?w=1024)\n\nExplore data and get insights from 2,700 commerce leaders.\n\nAI.
