Instead of simply automating existing processes, forward-thinking organizations are reimagining entire domains of work. This requires fundamentally rethinking how value is created and delivered, and it can only be realized through a bold, strategic approach to [change management](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/the-organization-blog/tag/change-management).\n\n**To fully harness the power of gen AI, organizations must recognize that technology alone is not enough.** While employees [are already ahead](/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/gen-ais-next-inflection-point-from-employee-experimentation-to-organizational-transformation) in experimenting with and understanding gen AI, organizational systems often lag behind. One way companies can start to catch up is through a thoughtful change management plan to enable and sustain the use of gen AI.\n\nDrawing on insights from first movers, we have identified four critical strategies that form the foundation for embedding gen AI within an organization. These can help foster a resilient, adaptive [culture](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/the-organization-blog/tag/culture) that not only withstands but thrives amidst rapid evolution.\n\n1. **Reframe gen AI as enabler of human potential**\n\n   Reframe gen AI as a tool that enhances, rather than replaces, human potential. Resistance often arises from fears of the unknown. Clearly communicate that it will augment work in a way that empowers employees to focus on higher-value activities. This shift in narrative reduces resistance and positions [AI as a catalyst](/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/the-organization-blog/how-generative-ai-could-support-not-replace-human-resources) for career growth.\n\n   Additionally, sharing real-world examples of how AI has been able to truly augment workflows and drive significant business outcomes can demystify it, make it relatable, and inspire employees to embrace its potential.\n\n   Acknowledging technology’s challenges and limitations, and inviting employees to help refine, can foster ownership and trust. This transparency can help deepen commitment as well, as employees see themselves as [active participants](/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/the-organization-blog/middle-managers-hold-the-key-to-unlock-generative-ai) in shaping the AI-driven future.\n2. **Gain insight from resistance**\n\n   Resistance is often perceived as a hurdle, but it can be a crucial source of insight when approached strategically. Engaging non-adopters early in the gen AI journey can help identify and address potential biases and resistance points before they escalate. These critical voices often surface challenges that early adopters might overlook, providing valuable feedback that can enhance and refine deployment.",
