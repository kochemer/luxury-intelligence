Leigh Buehler | 03/04/2024 Many consumers are aware of the profound transformation the retail industry is undergoing. By simply walking through your favorite stores, you can see that artificial intelligence (AI) technology in almost every area of retail. From enhancing the customer experience to optimizing operational processes and inventory management, AI has become a powerful tool for retailers looking to stay competitive in the dynamic retail landscape. Better Customer Insights by Using AI in RetailCompanies are putting a heavy focus on using AI to help with the customer experience. According to Retail Dive, Tractor Supply® CEO Hal Lawton stated that his company has “leveraged AI within its supply chain, human resources, and sales and marketing activities.” This company has a primary focus on customer service, so AI has aided Tractor Supply in improving their customer service.Tractor Supply uses an AI-powered tech assistant known as “Gura,” which stands for great, uncover, recommend, and ask. Any store associate can use this tool to bring high-quality service to customers.For example, imagine that a customer wants to find a type of dog food that helps with sensitive skin. A store associate can then use Gura to determine which foods would be the best fit for the customer, as well as find the inventory levels and price for a type of food in real time. Personalized Shopping ExperiencesOne of the key advantages of integrating AI in retail management is its ability to offer personalized shopping experiences. AI algorithms analyze vast amounts of valuable customer data – including purchase history, browsing behavior, and preferences – to create individualized recommendations.Amazon® excels in the use of AI technologies to create personalized customer recommendations. Its AI software uses machine learning to suggest products based on a customer's past purchases and the behavior of similar users. This software not only enhances customer satisfaction, but it also drives sales by presenting relevant items to shoppers based on business intelligence information.Amazon’s new notice of “high return rate” also helps customers redirect their search to the customer reviews section of a product page to help customers determine if an item is worth purchasing or if they might end up returning it. This use of AI also helps to control Amazon’s reverse logistics and inventory systems. Predictive Analytics for Demand ForecastingBusinesses can optimize their inventory management systems by using artificial intelligence for demand forecasting. AI analyzes historical sales data, market trends, and external factors. Then, it predicts future customer demand for products with a higher accuracy rate than traditional methods of forecasting.A great example of this data analysis is the use of AI by Walmart® to predict which products will be in demand during specific seasons. This type of high-quality analysis allows for better stock planning and reducing instances of overstock or stockouts.According to Chief Information Officer Dive, AI enhances Walmart’s daily supply chain workflows and anticipates cycles in demand, especially during peak events or unexpected events in customer traffic.However, it’s important to note that Walmart needed a multiyear approach to collect enough data and develop the software to create flexible algorithms for its AI tool. Using AI was a large investment of time, money, and resources, but its use has paid off for Walmart by creating a more seamless shopping experience for customers. AI-Driven Operational EfficiencyArtificial intelligence technologies can streamline various operational processes within an organization, which is particularly useful for leading retailers. The goal is to achieve better resource utilization, reduce costs, minimize errors, and increase productivity. Supply Chain OptimizationUsing AI for supply chain management provides real-time visibility and predictive capabilities. Retail businesses can use AI in their automated inventory management to track shipments, monitor inventory levels, and identify potential bottlenecks in the supply chain. As a result, operational efficiency improves and costs are reduced.According to Thomasnet, Swedish fashion retailer H&M® leverages AI to optimize its supply chains, analyze trends, and forecast demand, enabling the company to quickly respond to changing market demands and minimize lead times. The company’s AI tool is perfect for fast fashion; its software captures data from search engines and blogs so that AI algorithms can predict and analyze trends.The data aids H&M’s leaders in making retail operations decisions on how much to buy, when to buy it, and where to place it in the stores.
