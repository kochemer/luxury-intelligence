His father sent him to work as an apprentice to Monsieur Bernard Picard, a master fabricant of jewels and watches.Apprenticeship in those days was cruel, but it was an opportunity to enter the middle class and live a better life than his father. Cartier proved to be tenacious, and in 1847, at the age of 27, he negotiated a deal with his former boss to buy out the store.Louis-François Cartier studying during his retirement | Source: atelier Nadar, Public domain, via Wikimedia CommonsEven though Louis-Francois Cartier laid the foundation for his posterity to build the family Empire, success wasn’t certain at the beginning.Cartier’s first strategic decisions and Paris’s reformIn the early months of his business, Cartier had very specific challenges that he needed to overcome, and he would focus on doing exactly that.Firstly, Francois was still in debt to Picard and some family members from purchasing the store. Secondly, the Cartier business wasn’t distinguished or popular enough to attract renowned names with deep pockets that could sustain his business. So he realized that his first feasible goal was to establish his business name in the trade.How did he do that?His first move was to register his unique maker’s mark that would distinguish him from Picard on April 17, 1847. However, he knew that his master’s name bore enough respect that he could capitalize on it. So, within a year, Cartier put his name in the directory of Paris de Almanac as the “successor to M. Piccard.”Francois didn’t abandon the craft of making jewels, but he didn’t stop there either. He expanded his stock significantly, offering all sorts of jewelry, from crystal bracelets to diamond earrings and pearl accessories. To keep his business going, and since he couldn’t attract aristocracy, he would sell to his fellow jewelers and other workshops.But Cartier was unfortunate. Just one year after he opened his business, a detrimental, many-month-long revolution in Paris would jeopardize everything. For the next four years, Paris was in chaos, the jewelry market had sunk, and Louis-Francois had closed shop.In 1853, things started to change for the better.How Cartier pivoted and changed clienteleThe political situation stabilized once Napoleon III came into power.Napoleon wished to return France back to its former glory, so he focused on strengthening and modernizing the economy, making strong trade agreements, and rebuilding central Paris to encourage innovation and commercial expansion. As a result, the French middle and upper classes’ wealth increased significantly.At the same time, the salary str",
