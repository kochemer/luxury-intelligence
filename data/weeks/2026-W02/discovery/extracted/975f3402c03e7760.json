The focus is shifting firmly toward data tracing, from sourcing partners to supply chain networks, and there is significant interest in processing this data with the help of AI. Automation can ensure this wealth of information integrates seamlessly into PLM systems and becomes accessible across platforms. This shift is not optional; it is necessary. The volume of data retailers and brands must now track is exponentially higher than just a few years ago. Legislators and consumers alike are demanding transparency, sustainability, and accountability. The operational challenges are immense. The reality? Without advanced PLM modules, tailored automations, and integrated AI capabilities, managing this depth of data load would be next to impossible. Yet, while workloads have increased dramatically, team sizes remain largely unchanged. This is where technology becomes the enabler of both compliance and competitive advantage.

From raw material origins to lifecycle tracking, the data journey is comprehensive and complex. AI’s Role: Automating data analysis, identifying patterns, and generating actionable insights bridge the gap between compliance and efficiency. PLM Evolution: Modern PLMs must integrate seamlessly with automation scripts and AI systems to offer a scalable, sustainable solution. From PLM to Consumer Value: The data that is gathered around a product is not only valuable for legislative purposes. It can form the starting point in understanding more about the product and its journey. Used well, this can in turn improve future collections, help decision-making and have a positive effect on margins. The revolution in AI and automation is not just about keeping up, it is now about making the impossible possible. As the brands and retailers that we work with adopt these tools, they are not only meeting demands for transparency, but also unlocking new opportunities to connect with consumers and gaining the ability to show where they create sustainable value. We again must reimagine what is possible in the fashion industry. This time, legislation and the resulting data flow is playing a bigger role than ever before.",
