To be an industry leader tomorrow, you need a clear and compelling generative AI adoption strategy today.\n\n[Artificial intelligence](https://www.bcg.com/capabilities/artificial-intelligence) has reached a generational inflection point. With GenAI investments projected to increase by 60% in the next three years, [AI and GenAI ambitions](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2025/closing-the-ai-impact-gap) continue to grow across all sectors and functions.  \n  \nBut only [one in four executives](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2025/ai-fitness-for-ceos) say their companies are seeing significant returns from their AI and GenAI investments. To succeed, leaders must identify the critical business benefits of generative AI, targeting a handful of high-value initiatives that drive GenAI ROI.\n\nTech + Us: Harness the power of technology and AI\n[Manage Subscriptions](/subscription)\n\n## The Expansive Power of Generative AI\n\nWhat is the difference between generative AI and predictive AI (traditional AI)? \n\nAugmented by human interaction, predictive AI focuses on pattern recognition, forecasting outcomes, or making decisions based on historical data; it excels at tasks like classification, recommendations, and automation of rule-based processes.  \n  \nThe benefits of generative AI include helping humans create seemingly new content—text, images, code—based on what it has learned from data. The most powerful generative AI algorithms are built on top of foundation models that are trained on a vast quantity of unlabeled data to identify underlying patterns for a wide range of tasks. While significant generative AI customization still requires human expertise, adopting a generative model for a specific task can be accomplished with relatively low quantities of data or examples through APIs or by prompt engineering.\n\nWhat is the difference between generative AI and AI agents? \n\nGenerative AI powers the underlying capability to create content and understand complex instructions. [AI agents](https://www.bcg.com/capabilities/artificial-intelligence/ai-agents) go a step further—they use generative models to pursue goals; to reason, plan, and execute tasks across systems. While generative AI might write a report, an agent can interpret a business objective, gather the right data, write the report, and send it to the right people. Think of generative AI as an engine and AI agents as goal-oriented (digital) coworkers powered by that engine to act across systems, both guided and supervised by humans.\n\nHow is generative AI beneficial for businesses? \n\nThe biggest benefits of generative AI show up when GenAI initiatives are tied to core business functions, not just experiments. Enterprises benefit most when they move beyond isolated pilots and use GenAI to transform foundational workflows linked to strategic priorities. GenAI turns manual processes into fast, data-driven cycles, and is already unlocking tangible productivity gains across areas like software development, customer service (for example, smarter contact centers), marketing content, and R&D.\n\nWhat is the biggest challenge facing organizations that want to implement generative AI? \n\nThe biggest challenge to GenAI ROI is not the tech—it’s the people and the process. This type of change management is often overlooked, but top-performing organizations follow the 10-20-70 principle: they dedicate 10% of their efforts to algorithms; 20% to data and technology; and 70% to people, processes, and cultural transformation. Successful GenAI adoption requires redesigning how work gets done, redefining roles, upskilling teams, and fostering collaboration between humans and AI. Without this shift, even the best transformation efforts will fail to achieve their goals. Business leaders who invest in training and change management position their organizations to effectively accelerate generative AI adoption.\n\nWhat are the risks of generative AI? \n\nGenerative AI systems are democratizing AI capabilities that were previously inaccessible due to the lack of training data and required computing power. While wider GenAI adoption is a good thing, scaling generative AI become problematic when organizations don’t have an appropriate [responsible AI](https://www.bcg.com/capabilities/artificial-intelligence/responsible-ai) (RAI) framework in place from day one of deployment. As users experiment with these systems, generative AI risks need to be addressed:  \n\n* **Unknown Capabilities.** Large GenAI systems have exhibited a massive capability overhang—skills and dangers that are not planned for in the development phase and are generally unknown and unexpected even to the developers. This can pose a serious threat if the right guardrails are not in place to e",
