Handled by WPP Media, the initiative embraces a global media strategy led by large-scale out of home displays in major cities, including Paris, New York, London, Shanghai, Seoul, and Las Vegas. This activity is being backed by print collaborations in titles including the New York Times and the Financial Times, with the latter adapting its production to accommodate an over-cover which will not be printed on salmon paper, a first-ever break from the newspaper’s trademark for 132 years. Meanwhile, immersive content is accessible through a QR code integrated into the media strategy, designed to strengthen the interaction between the physical and the digital. These initiatives are supported by targeted activity on social media platforms. Founded by Louis-François Cartier in Paris in 1847, Cartier designs, manufactures, distributes, and sells jewellery, watches, leather goods, sunglasses and eyeglasses. The luxury goods company remained under family control until 1964. It is now a subsidiary of the Swiss Richemont Group and operates more than 200 stores in 125 countries, including what it calls “historical maisons” in Paris, London, and New York City. WPP Media Richemont global account director Jeanne DiMaira said: “We are proud to have supported Cartier in the distribution strategy of this ambitious campaign. Each activation was carefully designed by more than 40 local market teams to enhance the maison’s unique identity and create a lasting global impact.” WPP Media Cartier global lead Caroline Kovacs-Lopez added: “This exceptional campaign is the result of a particularly close and rich collaboration with Cartier, which allowed us to translate their creative vision into an extraordinary global multi-device strategy in every respect, offering a coherent and captivating experience that resonates with the most discerning audiences.” Related stories Spend up 8% as firms raid budgets to fight tariff chaos Bellwether reaction: Are one-to-one channels now king?
