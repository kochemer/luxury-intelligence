Enterprise AI now appears to be entering this phase.Today, we’re excited to introduce the state of enterprise AI report⁠(opens in a new window). For the first time, we’re sharing a comprehensive look at how enterprises are adopting AI, what workers say they’re gaining, and how organizational leaders are turning experimentation into measurable productivity and new capabilities.This analysis draws on two novel sources of data:Real-world usage data from enterprise customers of OpenAI.An OpenAI survey of 9,000 workers across almost 100 enterprises documenting patterns of AI adoption.All data points were deidentified and aggregated to preserve privacy.Adoption is accelerating and deepeningThe picture that emerges is clear: enterprise AI adoption is accelerating not just in breadth, but in depth. It is reshaping how people work, how teams collaborate, and how organizations build and deliver products.Over the past year weekly messages in ChatGPT Enterprise increased roughly 8×, and the average worker is sending 30% more messages.Usage of structured workflows such as Projects and Custom GPTs has increased 19× year-to-date, showing a shift from casual querying to integrated, repeatable processes.Average reasoning token consumption per organization has increased by approximately 320× in the past 12 months, suggesting that more intelligent models are being systematically integrated into expanding products and services.People aren’t just using AI more often. They are using it for increasingly sophisticated tasks. Enterprises are expanding both the extensive margin—more workers adopting AI—and the intensive margin—existing users going deeper.Growth is rapid across industries and geographiesAI is gaining traction across every sector, but we’re seeing especially strong momentum in:Technology, healthcare, and manufacturing, which are the fastest growing sectors.Professional services, finance, and technology, which operate at the largest scale.Globally, the fastest‑growing business customer bases include Australia, Brazil, the Netherlands, and France, each exceeding 140% year‑over‑year growth.International API customer growth has exceeded 70% over the last six months, with Japan having the largest number of corporate API customers outside of the U.S.Workers report measurable value from using AIAcross surveyed enterprises, 75% of workers report that using AI at work has improved either the speed or quality of their output. Workers report saving 40-60 minutes per day, with heavy users reporting more than 10 hours per week. Workers report AI is contributing to value across departments:87% of IT workers report faster IT issue resolution.85% of marketing and product users report faster campaign execution.75% of HR professionals report improved employee engagement.73% of engineers report faster code delivery.Crucially, AI is not just helping people do the same work faster—it is enabling people to do new kinds of work.Coding-related messages increased 36% for workers outside of technical functions.75% of users report being able to complete new tasks they previously could not perform.AI reduces the gap between intent and execution. Individuals can translate ideas into concrete outputs, regardless of their specialization or technical expertise.Frontier users and organizations are pulling aheadOur data shows a widening gap between “frontier” workers and firms, and the median.Frontier workers (95th percentile) send 6× more messages than the median employee and engage more intensively across advanced capabilities.Frontier firms send 2× more messages per seat and show deeper integration of AI across teams.These patterns are particularly meaningful given the finding that time savings increase as users consume more intelligence and engage across more distinct tasks.The AI landscape is evolving rapidly; OpenAI releases a new feature or capability roughly every three days. The primary constraints for organizations are no longer model performance or tooling, but rather organizational readiness and implementation.Looking ahead: AI reshaping the modern enterpriseThe state of enterprise AI report⁠(opens in a new window) is designed to do more than describe how AI adoption is changing, it’s meant to help organizations plan how to deploy more effectively. Based on real-world usage data, the report benchmarks how leading enterprises are deploying AI today, where they’re realizing val",
