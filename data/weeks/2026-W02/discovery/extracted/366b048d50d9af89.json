Andrea Hill is a multi-industry CEO covering business & technology.Follow AuthorOct 03, 2025, 06:20pm EDTOct 19, 2025, 04:47pm EDTThe focus is now shifting to AI and competitive advantage, as companies rethink what will set them apart in the years ahead.Even without significant new advances in the technology, AI will change the nature of competitive advantage.gettyA New Era of CompetitionBusiness history is marked by shifts in how companies create advantage. In the industrial age, efficiency ruled, as Henry Ford transformed car manufacturing by lowering costs through assembly lines. In the late 20th century, Walmart became a giant by driving relentless supply chain efficiency, while McDonald’s standardized processes to deliver speed and consistency worldwide. The digital era added a new edge: speed and customer access. Amazon, for example, can introduce new features dozens of times a day, while Netflix can spot changes in viewer preferences and launch new shows before its rivals even notice the trend.We now stand on the edge of another transformation. As McKinsey recently noted in its paper “The Agentic Organization: Contours of the Next Paradigm for the AI Era” (Sept. 2025), artificial intelligence is shifting the source of competitive advantage once again. This is not about clever tools or chatbots, but rather, about rethinking the fundamentals of how value is created.The companies that understand this shift and act on it will win market share. Those that wait risk being left behind.From Efficiency to IntelligenceThe introduction of AI into core business operations does more than speed things up. It changes the math of business itself. For most of history, the cost of serving more customers rose in step with growth. To sell more cars, Ford had to build more factories. To expand retail, Walmart had to hire more people and open more stores. Digital businesses gained efficiency in how they reached customers and processed transactions, removing some of the friction of physical operations, but costs still rose as they scaled.MORE FOR YOUAI-first workflows would shift that equation. Once a process is redesigned to run primarily through intelligent systems, the cost of serving one more customer becomes minimal. McKinsey researchers describe this effect as driving “marginal costs toward the cost of compute.” In plain English, this means that whether you handle one customer or one million, the extra cost is almost negligible.Consider customer service. In the past, doubling call volume meant doubling staff. With AI systems handling the bulk of routine questions, a company can scale to millions of interactions while reserving its people for only the most complex cases. Human attention becomes more valuable, because it is spent on higher-order problems, not on volume.This is why AI doesn’t just improve efficiency. It rewrites the rules of how companies grow.This is a fundamental break from the past. For most of history, growth and cost were tied together. To serve more customers, you needed more employees, more equipment, or more stores. In the AI era, the relationship between growth and cost loosens. This changes how growth works, allowing companies to get bigger without the traditional jump in costs.Data Becomes the Raw Material of AdvantageIf AI is the engine, data is the fuel. But not all data is equal. Public data (the information available to anyone) is now accessible through shared AI systems. That means it offers no real competitive edge to anyone.What matters is the data only your company can capture: the customer histories, usage patterns, performance records, and sensor readings that reflect how your products and services work in the real world. McKinsey describes this as building a “walled garden” of proprietary data that competitors cannot easily replicate.Consider a manufacturer that tracks performance across thousands of machines in its plants. By analyzing that data, it can predict failures, reduce downtime, and design better products faster than competitors. Or picture a bank that uses decades of transaction data to create financial services tailored not just to a demographic group, but to individual households. These are insights no competitor can simply copy.Unfortunately, many companies are still struggling with more than messy data. They are running on outdated systems that can’t talk to each other, patching gaps with spreadsheets, and piling on shadow software (often not integrated) just to keep things moving. Critical platforms like ERP systems are often long past their prime, but leaders hesitate to upgrade because the work will be expensive and overwhelming. The choice, however, is stark: do the hard work of modernization now, or lose the chance to compete while waiting a little longer. Companies that invest in fixing these foundat",
