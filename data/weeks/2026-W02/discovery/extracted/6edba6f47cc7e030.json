How Integrated eCommerce Platforms Can Accelerate GrowthKore TechnologiesFacebookXLinkedInOver the last decade, eCommerce has become a vital aspect of most product-oriented businesses. In 2023, eCommerce saw an estimated 1.8% increase in sales from 2022, equating to nearly 6 trillion dollars in revenue [1]. Knowing this, many companies have turned to various enterprise commerce solutions to maintain and improve their sales. Yet adopting the wrong eCommerce platforms has presented many organizations with issues, especially concerning their systems and data connectivity. One of the biggest hurdles organizations face with eCommerce platforms is how to maintain their business data. For companies looking to scale, having fast, reliable, and accurate access to eCommerce data is imperative. It can help improve customer experience, elevate business decisions, and make profit and growth more achievable. So how can you ensure strong, reliable, and accessible eCommerce data? One of the best methods to do so is utilizing integrated eCommerce platforms. What are Integrated eCommerce Platforms?An integrated eCommerce platform is one that connects the front-end of your business to your back-office systems. This means that it can exchange, organize, and utilize data between systems and applications like your ERP, CRM, transportation warehouse managing systems, etc. By integrating with your back end, you can ensure timely and consistent data across your organization and customer-facing platform. It can help you keep up with inventory, pricing, and sales, providing a clear advantage over non-integrated platforms. Why Choose Integrated eCommerce Services?One of the most important aspects of an integrated eCommerce platform is the improvement of customer experience. According to Digital Commerce 360, surveyed companies found that customer-friendly eCommerce websites saw buyers spend 62% more on their products [2]. Clearly, providing customers with quality shopping experiences is vital toward boosting sales. Integrated eCommerce solutions can enable these quality experiences by providing optimized, self-service capabilities to customers. These services are designed to enhance the performance and ease-of-use of the website, including features like real-time pricing, package tracking, easy checkout processes, online payment tools, and strong website security. For both B2B and B2C buyers, these aspects of an integrated eCommerce platform can give them a strong sense of control over their shopping process. As well, integrated eCommerce services provide a major internal advantage to organizations. Some of these benefits can lead to: Reduced manual labor Increased visibility of customer data Improved data reporting Automated sales processes Overall, these platforms are designed to make it easy for your customers to do business with you. Five Great Benefits of eCommerce IntegrationAs we’ve covered some of the advantages of using integrated eCommerce, here are five additional benefits these platforms can provide: No More Manual Order Entry A major struggle of any business is manually maintaining its order volume. While manual order entry can work, it can also become greatly inefficient and inaccurate. Integrated eCommerce for manufacturers and distributors helps reduce this inefficiency by automating the entry process, eliminating errors, and improving dataflow and speed. Consolidated Inventory and Sales Data A report from IHL estimated 1.77 trillion dollars of lost revenue worldwide caused by inventory distortion in 2023 [3]. However, with an integrated eCommerce platform that connects with your back end, you can ensure that the pricing and inventory data for your organization is accurate. This helps improve customer experience, allowing for real-time updates on pricing and inventory levels as customers shop online. Greater Sales Management With synchronized data flow and accurate customer data, you can optimize your sales management process. This data can help optimize your sales operations and strategies, while also allowing for superior reporting on sales, customer-behavior, product performance, etc. Sustainable Future Having stronger customer experience and less manual data entry means that your business can run more smoothly and efficiently. This will allow your company to grow, succeed, and flourish sustainably in the future. With all your data managed and connected, an AI-driven eCommerce solution could be the perfect choice to scale your company. Enhanced Customer Experience Gaining and retaining customers relies on a good product or service. Surveyed companies with integrated, customer-friendly eCommerce platforms saw a 70% customer retention rate, as opposed to the 49% who that not.
