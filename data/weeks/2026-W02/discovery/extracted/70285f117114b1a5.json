Report this article Thomas Wieringa Thomas Wieringa Published Mar 6, 2025 + Follow I hate writing about AI—there’s already an endless stream of articles and opinions on the topic. Yet, every day in my line of work, I witness brands grappling with the promise of AI, believing it can solve every problem. This overreliance on technology not only oversimplifies complex challenges but also dangerously underestimates the unparalleled power of human connection—the true holy grail of private client engagement. In the world of luxury, where every detail is meticulously crafted to evoke emotion and exclusivity, AI must be seen as an enabler, not a replacer. The magic of luxury is born from experiential marketing and one-on-one engagements that build lasting relationships. No algorithm, however advanced, can replicate the bespoke charm of a personal consultation or the unforgettable ambiance of a high-end event. Luxury brands have always thrived on exclusivity, personal service, and immersive experiences. In recent years, artificial intelligence has quietly become a game-changer for the luxury industry – but not by automating it away. Instead, AI is emerging as the ultimate concierge behind the scenes, enhancing bespoke experiences without replacing the human touch. From high-end retail boutiques and five-star hotels to luxury auto showrooms and private banks, the message is clear: AI’s role is to support and elevate the luxury experience, while the magic of human connection and physical brand engagement remains paramount. The High-Tech, High-Touch Paradox in Luxury Recent research from top consultancies and industry reports reveals that while AI holds immense promise for boosting operational efficiencies and personalizing the customer journey, luxury brands are treading carefully. For instance, a 2024 Bain & Company study noted that while many luxury maisons have only implemented a few AI-driven solutions, nearly every brand is actively exploring additional applications to enhance customer engagement and streamline internal processes. Similarly, McKinsey’s latest findings suggest that generative AI alone could add up to $275 billion in operating profits to the fashion and luxury sectors over the next few years. Yet caution tempers this excitement. Both analysts and luxury executives recognize that AI must not dilute luxury’s essence of authenticity, creativity, and emotional resonance. Bain’s study notes that brands are wary of deploying AI in core creative functions for fear of “altering luxury’s essence or compromising its authenticity”. This mirrors findings from the the State of Fashion 2024 survey, where 73% of fashion executives named generative AI a top priority, but only 28% had experimented with AI in design and product development – highlighting a prudent wait-and-see approach in creative areas. Yet, the real insight here is not in the raw numbers but in the strategy behind them. Luxury brands understand that while AI can analyze data, predict trends, and optimize logistics, it cannot replace the sensory, emotional, and experiential aspects of luxury. AI-powered chatbots might provide immediate responses, but they can’t replicate the warmth of a face-to-face conversation or the personal touch of a dedicated client advisor. AI: The Enabler, Not the Replacer Across the luxury spectrum—from high-end fashion and fine spirits to automotive excellence and private banking—the message is consistent: AI is an enabler, not a replacer. Technology can process vast amounts of data, forecast trends, and optimize operations with unprecedented speed and accuracy. But at the end of the day, luxury is about creating an emotional, sensory experience that leaves a lasting imprint on the client’s heart. When a client walks into a boutique, attends a private event, or receives a personal consultation, what they experience is far more than just efficiency. They experience care, passion, and an unwavering commitment to excellence. AI’s role is to provide the insights and efficiencies that empower human experts to deliver these moments of connection. As I often remind my clients, “No matter how sophisticated your digital tools become, the physical 1:1 engagements in a private client program between client and brand cannot be replaced by AI.” Experiential Marketing: The Unrivaled Heart of Luxury Built on a foundation of emotions, storytelling, and sensory indulgence, luxury is an arena where no algorithm can capture the full magic. Even as AI scales personalized marketing, top-tier luxury brands are ramping up their investment in experiential marketing—80% of companies are increasing their budgets, allocating as much as 30% to immersive, real-world engagements. These brands are crafting elaborate events and bespoke moments that go far beyond digital interactions to forge lasting memories. Why this unwavering focus on experiences? Today’s affluent m",
