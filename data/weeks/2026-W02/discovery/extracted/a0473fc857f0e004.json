We wrote this 6-step guide to put you on the path to seamless implementation. It strikes a balance between technical know-how and strategic thinking—everything you care about as a CTO. Ready to bring AI to the heart of your product?With our expertise in AI-Native product development, we handle every step—from strategy and PoC validation to deployment and optimization.Let us build intelligent, adaptive, and impactful user experiences while you focus on driving your business forward.Partner with HatchWorks AI to make it happen. Implementation can’t begin until you know how you want to use an LLM in your business. So, we’ll start there—think of it as a precursory step. Your use case will determine the value you extract from this bit of tech. Start by examining your current operations: Where are the bottlenecks? What tasks eat up too much time? Which processes could benefit from faster access to proprietary data? Your answers will point you toward potential LLM applications. Need some inspiration? Morgan Stanley equipped their wealth advisors with an OpenAI-powered assistant that helped them give better financial advice to clients. In the healthcare sector, Apollo 24|7 is using Google’s MedPaLM with RAG to pull up relevant medical info in a pinch. And Cox2M (a HatchWorks AI client) has used RAG to give their customers real-time insights into their fleets. Cox2M's AI Breakthrough in Fleet Management Challenge: Cox2M aimed to create a Generative AI trip analysis assistant for their Kayo fleet management customers, providing real-time, accurate natural language responses about complex fleet data.Solution: HatchWorks AI developed the Kayo AI Assistant by implementing our RAG Accelerator enabling customers to get real time insights about their fleet through natural language.Results: The scalable, cost-effective system was delivered on time, enabling easy implementation and scaling across cloud platforms, enhancing fleet management. These examples show how LLMs can enhance decision-making, automate information retrieval, and improve customer experience.Your use case might resemble one of these examples or be entirely unique. If you’re unsure where to start, we’re here to help. Get in touch with us here and we’ll chat through the possibilities specific to your business.📚RAG resources you’ll love: RAG for Healthcare, RAG for Financial Services 6 Steps to Integrating an LLM into Your Business Now that you’ve pinpointed your use case, you can begin implementation of the LLM into your business. These 6 steps can be a little technical, but they’re relatively straight forward. Expert tip:If you find you don’t have the in-house support to apply them, HatchWorks AI does and we’re happy to lend our expertise. You can upskill using our AI resources or engage us in the way that best meets your needs (staff augmentation, dedicated agile teams, or outcome based projects)Check those engagement options out here. Step 1: Choosing the Right LLMGood news—you don’t need to build and train an LLM from scratch. Instead, you can use one that already exists (and there’s a wide range available). From GPT models to BERT variants, each has its own strengths and is built to specific use cases.That’s why your choice matters so much. If you were hanging a picture on your wall and you had a hammer and wrench in front of you, which would you choose? While both are useful, one is the right tool for this particular job. It’s the same with different LLMsYou want to find one that’s been trained to efficiently execute the tasks you have in mind.The first decision to make is simple: use a managed service or host your own.Managed services make it very easy to get up to speed, interacting with an API. Companies including OpenAI and Anthropic expose their LLMs through accessible APIs. Hyperscalers also offer LLM marketplaces, such as GCP’s ModelGarden, and managed LLM services, such as Amazon Q.But managed services aren’t always the best option –commercially, the unit economics of consuming hosted models may not be feasible;functionally, the performance of a hosted model may fall short for your specific use-case;security-wise, the transfer of code or data to a third-party service can be prohibitive in highly regulated or competitive industries.If you decide you are looking to host your own, your first stop should be the Hugging Face Repository. That’s where our HatchWorks developers always go.It’s a treasure trove of LLMs, complete with filters to ",
