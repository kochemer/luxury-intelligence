The agreement reflects a growing industry trend of using artificial intelligence to optimise complex delivery operations.

The technology is designed to intelligently link disparate points in the delivery chain, improve operational visibility, and help planners optimise routes and territory assignments for couriers — all of which can increase productivity and lower costs in parcel movement. A key focus of the collaboration is the planned launch of same‑day delivery services for time‑critical shipments, made possible by the platform’s advanced routing algorithms that provide more accurate delivery windows and time‑slot options for customers. Such capabilities are increasingly important in competitive e‑commerce and express logistics markets where customer expectations for speed and transparency are high. In addition to delivery planning, the partnership includes trials of workforce and territory optimisation tools that help the carrier plan delivery zones more efficiently, boosting courier output and reducing unnecessary travel. These AI‑powered features aim to make the last mile more agile and cost‑effective while enhancing overall customer experience. The logistics operator’s investment in AI also underscores broader industry shifts toward digital transformation, predictive planning and data‑driven supply chain automation as competitive necessities rather than optional technologies. #BreakingNews #SupplyChainNews #LastMileLogistics #AIinLogistics #LogisticsInnovation",
