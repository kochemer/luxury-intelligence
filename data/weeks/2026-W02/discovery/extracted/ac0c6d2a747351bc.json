This artificial intelligence technology brings innovative solutions to the complex challenges of urban and rural logistics, radically transforming how parcels reach their final destination.In a context where consumer expectations for speed, flexibility, and personalization continue to grow, machine learning offers delivery companies powerful tools to optimize their operations and enhance customer satisfaction. From anticipating organizational changes and personalizing the customer experience to optimizing delivery routes and automating processes, this technology is revolutionizing every aspect of the last-mile logistics chain.This article explores 8 major innovations made possible by machine learning, illustrating how this technology is transforming the delivery landscape and paving the way for a future where efficiency, sustainability, and customer satisfaction go hand in hand. 1. Anticipating organizational changes Machine learning is revolutionizing strategic planning in last-mile delivery by enabling companies to anticipate and prepare for significant organizational changes. Advanced algorithms can simulate various scenarios, providing valuable insights for decision-making:Volume fluctuations: Systems predict seasonal or occasional demand variations, allowing for resource adjustments accordingly.Client portfolio evolution: AI models the impact of adding or losing major clients, helping adapt logistical capacity.Peak season preparation: Algorithms simulate strategies for handling activity peaks, optimizing resource allocation and workforce planning.Transition to electric fleets: Machine learning aids in planning the gradual electrification of fleets by analyzing routes, range limitations, and charging infrastructure needs.Geographical expansion: AI tools model the impact of expanding to new delivery areas, forecasting resource needs and potential challenges.This ability to simulate complex scenarios enables companies to efficiently prepare for changes, optimize investments, and maintain high service levels despite shifts in their operational environment. 💡 Kardinal’s solution supports logistics players in anticipating and optimizing their organizational changes: adding or removing depots, integrating new vehicles (electric vehicles, cargo bikes, etc.), handling volume fluctuations, reorganizing the territory managed by subcontractors, and more. 2. Automatic address validation and correction AI-powered tools are revolutionizing address management in last-mile delivery by offering a robust solution to a recurring and costly issue. These advanced systems analyze addresses in real time when orders are placed, comparing them to constantly updated geographic databases. Through continuous learning, they improve by drawing insights from previous corrections and successful deliveries.They automatically correct spelling errors in street or city names, identify and fix incorrect postal codes, and fill in missing information like floor numbers. Additionally, they standardize address formats according to local postal regulations and recognize different variations of the same address.This technology brings significant benefits to delivery companies. It greatly reduces delivery failures caused by incorrect addresses, leading to substantial operational savings. Customer experience improves through fewer delays and delivery errors. Moreover, accurate addresses enable better route planning, optimizing the entire logistics process. 3. Smart assignment of drivers Machine learning can revolutionize route assignments by analyzing a multitude of factors to optimize driver allocation. This sophisticated approach goes beyond simple geographic distribution, as machine learning algorithms can incorporate several key elements:Performance history: The system analyzes each driver’s historical data, including delivery times, success rates, and customer satisfaction.Specialized skills: Drivers with specific skills (handling heavy packages, assembling furniture, etc.) are considered in the system’s decisions.Local knowledge: A driver’s experience in a particular area is valued, leading to more ",
