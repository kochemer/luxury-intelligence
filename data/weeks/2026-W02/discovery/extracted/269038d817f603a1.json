Our artificial intelligence consultants treat every AI business transformation as a unique journey, shaped around an organization’s starting point, circumstances, and goals. To successfully deploy AI at scale and capitalize on the impact of AI on business, we prioritize a 10-20-70 approach that emphasizes algorithms (10%), tech and data (20%), and people and processes (70%). With these capabilities in hand, companies are embarking on AI transformation journeys that focus on ambitious targets and superior AI value creation.\n\nC-suite leaders looking to maximize the benefits of AI in business *and* their value potential should be experimenting with AI as early as possible, capitalizing on near-term [cost management](https://www.bcg.com/capabilities/cost-management) opportunities.
