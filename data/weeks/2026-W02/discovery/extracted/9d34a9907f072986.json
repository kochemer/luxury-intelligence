Businesses must keep up with major players like Amazon, Uber, and Walmart, which rely on cutting-edge technology to make last-mile delivery faster, more traceable, and efficient. With customer expectations increasing, more businesses implement technology to expedite shipping requests, and several notable trends in the last-mile delivery market are emerging. Last-Mile Delivery Explained Last-mile delivery is a term that typically refers to the final leg of a package's journey to a residential address. It can also include businesses and other destinations. Last-mile delivery is commonly considered the most challenging and costly part of the delivery process because it involves navigating complex residential areas to deliver packages to individual homes and buildings. An ever-evolving field, last-mile delivery is influenced by various trends and statistics, including technological advancements, consumer demands, and logistics challenges. In the current market, many businesses are discovering advanced technologies that improve their mobile operations’ efficiency, irrespective of the size of their fleet or number of drivers, reducing costs and improving customer service. Current and Future Trends in Last-Mile Delivery Innovation The e-commerce industry is largely driving the growth of the last-mile delivery industry. With the increasing popularity of online shopping, the demand for last-mile delivery services is expected to grow. According to recent statistics, the global Last-Mile Delivery for the E-commerce market was worth USD $38.5 million in 2021 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12.1% over the forecast period, reaching USD $76.5 million by 2027. Consumers today have higher expectations and want same-day or next-day delivery options and complete transparency throughout the shipping process. Meeting these demands and providing a positive customer experience is critical for cultivating brand loyalty and remaining competitive in the current and future marketplace. Last-mile delivery innovation and technology are making it possible to meet market demands and more. Businesses increasingly leverage smart technology, drones, delivery robots, and electric vehicles to help streamline operations, reduce costs, and improve delivery times. While trends vary depending on location, industry, and the specific needs of each delivery, we will look at these innovative technologies in greater detail below. Smart Tech and Real-Time Tracking Customers want more certainty, convenience, and visibility in their delivery options. Therefore, companies must find new ways to meet the expectations of consumers and businesses, who want precise delivery times and the assurance that their purchases will arrive on time. Real-time tracking using smart technology plays a major role in supporting a faster and more transparent last-mile delivery process to connect the planned delivery time to the current whereabouts. With the use of IoT-enabled sensors and GPS-enabled devices, every shipment movement can be tracked. Further, artificial intelligence and machine learning technology, like Tourmo AI, is being deployed to analyze data to predict demand and anticipate potential problems while automating many operational processes required to streamline the entire delivery process. Companies that do not use smart tech should evaluate their current technology solutions and consider incorporating this technology to optimize their last-mile delivery operations by making them highly transparent and reliable. Hybrid Fleet Management Systems and Insourcing Many businesses are incorporating the latest last-mile delivery trend, “hybrid fleet management.” It combines a trucking company's vehicles with outside contractors, third-party providers, and freelance drivers to adjust the fleet size to match fluctuations in demand and keep capital costs down. Conversely, many companies manage the last-mile delivery internally, using their own fleet vehicles or a combination of company-owned and contracted vehicles, rather than outsourcing the delivery. Businesses that go for this option, a.k.a. insourcing, can gain better control over their delivery operations while avoiding some of the downsides of conventional outsourcing. Despite this, outsourcing remains the preferred choice, with many companies collaborating with third parties to decrease last-mile delivery expenses. The hybrid fleet management trend has led some third-party logistics providers to create their own local delivery service to rival insourcing, complete with vehicles and personnel for local deliveries.
