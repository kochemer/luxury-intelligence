Retail data is a necessary foundation for CPG operations and decision-making, providing suppliers with crucial visibility into real-time retail and inventory movements across thousands of touchpoints. It’s vital in an age where shopper behavior and product trends are in constant flux. Beyond day-to-day functions, however, the amount of retail data suppliers incur across the omnichannel landscape can be so expansive and granular that it can become overwhelming to analyze and extract meaningful insights from. That could be why AI — known for its efficiency and productivity possibilities — presents such a compelling opportunity for the retail and consumer goods industry, with an estimated potential impact of $400 billion to $660 billion annually; driven by AI-supported strategic growth and cost savings through automation of key functions. This value hasn’t gone unnoticed. Retailers’ investments in AI to realize this value have led to two key developments: consumer technology that personalizes shopping experiences and drives purchase behavior; and new, more robust data infrastructure and reporting solutions to drive supplier success. While the wealth of new data made available by retailers is beneficial, their AI-driven visions also raise the bar for performance, demanding faster response times and fulfillment. AI-powered analytics can accelerate suppliers’ time-to-insight and help them make smarter, faster decisions around demand forecasting, inventory management, and business planning, ensuring the adaptability of their operations. But there’s a learning curve — with over 85% of generative AI projects initiated by companies failing to reach production this year. As we’re beginning to understand, the major roadblock is underdeveloped data that fails to meet the intricate, highly granular requirements of large language models (LLMs) and other similar foundation models. While AI promises extreme automation and industry transformation, thoughtfully structured data is essential for the accurate and integrated use of AI tools in retail analytics. In this article, we uncover how to harness retail data for fast, reliable, and powerful AI-powered insights and offer clear paths that organizations can take to begin realizing enterprise-wide value today. The major roadblock [in generative AI project project production] is underdeveloped data that fails to meet the intricate, highly granular requirements of large language models (LLMs) and other similar foundation models. Data as the foundation For CPG suppliers, retail data sources span retailers and distributors of all types, each with their own disparate nomenclature and structure. Millions of records of highly granular data that tracks inventory and sales from distribution centers through to individual consumer purchases at the store level are generated every day. Crisp’s data platform ingests, normalizes, and harmonizes this data from multiple sources, creating a unified foundation for analytics and decision-making. However, suppliers need to take data preparedness a step further to leverage AI’s power in retail analytics. This is where a semantic layer comes in, building consistent, natural business language around disparate data sources, and enriching it with logic and context tailored to the nuances of a unique industry. The semantic layer adds crucial meaning and context to normalized data. This is because while a generative AI model might recognize terms like ‘Dollar Velocity’ or ‘Share of Category YoY Growth,’ it needs to have the understanding of their precise definitions and business context to contribute actionable insights. The semantic layer explicitly defines these metrics, establishes their relationships, and encodes the underlying business logic, empowering CPG teams to draw insights that seamlessly inform inventory management, merchandising, growth strategies, and more. Recognizing this need, Crisp has created the first semantic layer specifically for the retail industry. This added embedded technology provides the context necessary to transform collective retail data sources into natural language queryable information. It can be utilized across departments for fast, reliable insights regardless of technical expertise, heralding a major unlock in AI-driven efficiency.

Interacting with intelligence With a robust data foundation in place, what comes next? How can businesses leverage AI-ready retail data for even faster, more thoughtful decision-",
