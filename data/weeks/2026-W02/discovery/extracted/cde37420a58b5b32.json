Of course, the tightening of shoppers’ pursestrings directly impacts retailers in a number of ways. After seemingly endless increases in inflation, supply chain disruptions, and an ever-looming recession threat, spending is expected to decrease, with people having less money for nonessential purchases. Customer loyalty is also expected to wane, as Women’s Wear Daily reports that 74% of people are trading down to shop with cheaper brands than they’d prefer. Amongst what sounds like a lot of doom and gloom, we see the rise of AI, which offers retailers faster, more accurate, and cost-effective ways to list, market, supply, and sell products. There’s a ton of hype around the technology, making it feel like the big shiny tech obsession du jour, but it also offers a ton of promise. There are many AI solutions that solve smaller issues here and there, but the very best retail AI will integrate into multiple functionalities and improve outcomes across the entire retail operation. This is where AI’s retail promise during economic uncertainty lies. Can AI Foster Connections to Drive Sales? Artificial intelligence can bring humanity to shopping through crafting empathetic experiences that reflect the customer. Lily AI does this by injecting the language of the customer throughout the entire retail ecosystem, connecting people with the exact products they’re looking for. This helps drive sales, of course, but it also fosters brand loyalty by making consumers feel seen in highly personalized retail experiences. Personalized experiences are critical to get right. 66% of consumers say they’ll leave a brand if they don’t receive a personalized shopping experience. Meanwhile, revenue increased by 90% on average when brands invested in digital customer engagement. In those aforementioned metrics alone, we see a big opportunity for AI to impact profitability. Even beyond personalization and fostering brand loyalty, artificial intelligence impacts other areas of retail marketing, forecasting, shopping, and more. Here, we dive into key ways AI boosts profitability across the entire retail chain, delivering real value during economic uncertainty with measurable, quantifiable results. How Does AI Boost Retail Profitability During Economic Uncertainty? Here, we dive into a few ways AI boosts retail profitability in a world where the only constant seems to be a future full of economic uncertainty. Demand Forecasting As one of the most critical parts of the retail process, merchandising teams can be assisted by AI to make stronger purchasing decisions. Lily AI’s algorithms analyze historical sales data, market trends, and external factors (like those economic conditions we’ve discussed so much) to accurately predict product demands. This helps teams in merchandising departments optimize their inventory levels, reduce stockouts, and minimize excess inventory costs. Personalized Recommendations & Marketing Much like the brand building and loyalty fostering we discussed earlier, AI helps retail marketers create personalized campaigns that feel tailored to individual consumers’ preferences and behaviors. We can see this at play in product recommendations, which when done right, provides massive upsell opportunities. By analyzing customer data, AI recommends products that people are more likely to purchase. These are based on their own personal styles, preferences, and historic purchases. Even before consumers reach your site, your Google Search efforts can be enhanced by AI’s insertion of customer-centric language throughout product details, landing pages, and your online store. Just as any classic Google Search operation works, more people are driven to your shop . . . but thanks to the supercharged pace and attribution details provided by AI, the net retailers cast with it is wider than ever before. Super-Charged Search Systems Continuing on the topic of enhancing the actual online shopping experience, AI-powered technology supercharges your on-site search. Because products are enhanced with customer-focused language—which includes product details like fit, texture, and closures, as well as timely trends and subjective synonyms—people can pin-point exactly what they’re looking for by simply searching for it on your site. By using a combination of AI, large language modeling, and computer vision, Lily AI serves people the exact products they’re looking for. When using AI-powered on-site search, products will feel personalized and tailored to each individual shopper’s needs. Website usability is at its peak, and the right products are connected to customers quickly and easily. Content Generation Saves Time & Enhances Productivity While we’ve talked about driving sales thus far, we cannot neglect to mention that AI offers big opportunities for saving time and enhancing productivity. These savings can have a h",
