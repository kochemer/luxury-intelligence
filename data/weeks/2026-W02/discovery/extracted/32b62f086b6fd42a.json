It’s a family of models, each with different strengths.Some are built for speed. Some are optimized for deep reasoning. Some handle massive amounts of context.But with so many versions—GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4o—it’s easy to lose track of what’s what.That’s why we’re breaking it all down.In this guide, we’ll go model by model, explaining what each of the major OpenAI model does best.GPT-4GPT-4 was one of the most anticipated AI releases of 2023. After the groundbreaking impact of GPT-3 and GPT-3.5, the world was waiting for OpenAI’s next major leap. Speculation ran wild—would GPT-4 be AGI? Would it be 100x smarter than GPT-3? Would it completely revolutionize AI applications?When OpenAI finally launched GPT-4 on March 14, 2023, it didn’t come with an AGI breakthrough—but it was a significant step forward. It introduced better reasoning, enhanced accuracy, and multimodal capabilities (the ability to understand both text and images). It wasn’t just “bigger,” it was smarter and more reliable.However, there was one downside: it was expensive and slower compared to GPT-3.5. OpenAI focused on quality over cost, which meant GPT-4 was primarily used for high-end applications rather than everyday AI tasks.What OpenAI Thinks About GPT-4OpenAI positioned GPT-4 as a major refinement of AI intelligence. According to OpenAI:It’s far more accurate than GPT-3.5, reducing hallucinations and misinformation.It has improved logical reasoning and is better at handling complex tasks.It’s multimodal, meaning it can process both text and images (though the image input feature was limited to certain applications).It’s more aligned with human values and safety, making it less likely to generate harmful content.Essentially, GPT-4 was a thinking AI, not just a talking one.Strengths of GPT-4Better at following instructions – More nuanced, context-aware, and reliable.Higher reasoning capabilities – Can process complex queries with greater accuracy.Multimodal abilities – Can interpret and generate text and understand images.Safer AI interactions – Improved content moderation and ethical safeguards.Release TimelineMarch 14, 2023 – OpenAI officially launched GPT-4 for ChatGPT Plus users and API access.July 2023 – OpenAI expanded API availability to more developers.API Pricing for GPT-4GPT-4 was more expensive than GPT-3.5, making it suitable for high-end applications. Here’s the API pricing:Input tokens: $0.03 per 1,000 tokensOutput tokens: $0.06 per 1,000 tokensDue to these costs, many developers used GPT-4 selectively for critical tasks while relying on GPT-3.5 for cheaper, high-volume operations.What You Can Build With GPT-4 (Using the API)GPT-4’s intelligence and reasoning made it ideal for:Legal and financial AI tools – More precise contract analysis, financial forecasting, and compliance automation.Advanced AI tutors – Personalized education tools for complex subjects like mathematics and coding.AI for research & data analysis – Assisting in scientific research and business intelligence.Medical AI applications – Assisting with diagnosis, summarizing medical literature, and patient interactions.Creative AI – Generating scripts, poetry, and deep storytelling content.GPT-4 TurboGPT-4 Turbo arrived at a time of uncertainty in the AI world. OpenAI had already released GPT-4, which was widely seen as a gold standard for general AI performance. Yet, competitors like Anthropic (Claude), Google DeepMind (Gemini), and Mistral were gaining ground, offering powerful alternatives with different cost and speed trade-offs.Users were expecting GPT-5, but OpenAI took a different approach—rather than rushing a completely new version, they focused on optimization. The goal? Make GPT-4 significantly cheaper, faster, and more scalable.Sam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO, positioned GPT-4 Turbo as the “smarter” way forward—instead of just pushing a raw intelligence upgrade, OpenAI fine-tuned the model to deliver similar or better performance at a fraction of the cost. It was a move that catered to developers, businesses, and AI-powered applications that needed to scale without skyrocketing expenses.What OpenAI Thinks About GPT-4 TurboOpenAI describes GPT-4 Turbo as a high-efficiency AI model that balances intelligence, speed, and affordability. According to OpenAI, it’s:Faster and cheaper than standard GPT-4, making it the best option for API-based applications.Still as powerful as GPT-4, with slight improvements in reasoning and cost efficiency.A strategic move to ensure AI remains widely accessible for developers.Essentially, G",
