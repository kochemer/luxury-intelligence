AI companies should choose pricing models that support revenue and profitability goals, while remaining competitive within the business’ market segment. AI companies have several pricing strategy options to choose from, each with distinct advantages depending on your business model, target market, and product maturity. Prices are set based on a variety of factors, including: Marketing conditions. Customer behavior. Competitive forces. Volume or usage-based variables. Customers already have an appetite for AI solutions. Of marketing leaders, 91% say their teams are already using AI, and 43% of sales professionals use AI in their work. Currently, from a marketing and sales standpoint, I’m seeing companies use AI platforms to help them make better data-driven decisions around their pricing strategies. Pro tips: HubSpot Sales Hub supports flexible payment processing, making it easy for businesses to implement multiple pricing strategies all within a unified platform that connects to the CRM. Dynamic and token-based pricing capabilities are a part of HubSpot’s robust integrations ecosystem. Pricing Strategies that Work Well for AI Companies AI companies have different pricing considerations than other businesses. In fact, AI pricing strategies need to factor in computational costs, rapid product evolution, and diverse customer needs. However, when picking an AI pricing strategy, most companies choose one of the following approaches: Usage-based pricing. Tiered subscription pricing. Freemium pricing. Value-based pricing. Or a hybrid approach. Usage-Based Pricing Usage-based payment is an AI pricing strategy that charges customers based on how often they use the AI product. That means users are charged per API call, processing time, tokens used, or data analyzed. This approach is popular among AI companies because it aligns costs with value delivery and scales naturally with customer growth. Companies like OpenAI and Anthropic use this approach, making AI accessible to startups while capturing revenue from enterprise-scale usage. Tiered Subscription Pricing Tiered subscription pricing lets AI companies serve different customer segments with a single product. The companies offer multiple tiers (often, Basic, Professional, and Enterprise). Each tier includes specific feature sets, usage limits, or service levels. HubSpot is an example of an AI service that offers tier-based pricing. Starter, Pro, and Enterprise all offer different AI-powered features for a set price. Users are not charged based on how many times they use an AI feature. Tiered subscription pricing provides predictable revenue and helps customers understand exactly what they're getting at each price point. Pro tip: Setting up tiered pricing structures is straightforward in HubSpot Sales Hub, and Content Hub's drag-and-drop website builder makes it simple to create clear, professional pricing pages that communicate tier differences effectively. Freemium Models Providing free access to basic AI capabilities attracts users and demonstrates value before asking for payment.
