Super.workAn AI-powered enterprise search platform that connects all your business tools to provide instant, comprehensive answers from scattered organizational data.Super.work addresses one of the most persistent productivity challenges in modern business: information fragmentation. While teams use multiple specialized tools for different functions, critical knowledge gets scattered across Slack conversations, Linear tickets, GitHub discussions, Google Drive files, and dozens of other platforms. Super.work bridges this gap by creating a unified search layer that works across your entire tech stack.The platform uses advanced AI to understand natural language queries and search simultaneously across all connected tools. Instead of checking five different applications to answer \"What's our customer onboarding process?\", users get comprehensive responses with source citations from everywhere the information exists. This eliminates the daily friction of hunting through multiple tools for complete answers.What sets Super.work apart is its contextual understanding of how teams actually work. It learns your company's terminology, processes, and tool usage patterns, becoming more intelligent about surfacing relevant information over time. The AI doesn't try to replace human decision-making but enhances it by ensuring teams have complete context when making choices.Key features:Universal search across 20+ business applications including Slack, Google Drive, Linear, GitHub, HubSpot, and moreNatural language AI that understands context and provides comprehensive answers with source citationsWorks within existing workflows through Slack integration, Chrome extension, and web interfaceMaintains existing security permissions across all connected toolsSuper.work is particularly valuable for engineering teams who need to find technical decisions across code repositories and discussion threads, customer-facing teams who require context from multiple touchpoints, and growing companies where knowledge sharing becomes increasingly complex. Sales teams can quickly access customer history across CRM, support tickets, and internal discussions. Support teams can find solutions that span documentation, product updates, and previous case resolutions.Any organization using multiple business tools where teams spend significant time searching for information across platforms will find Super.work transforms their information access from frustrating to effortless. At $15 per user per month, it typically pays for itself by recovering just 30 minutes of search time per person per day.2.
