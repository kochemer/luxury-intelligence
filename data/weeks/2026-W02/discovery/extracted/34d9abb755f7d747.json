The air is thick with anticipation as models glide through a labyrinth of high-speed processors and tangled cables, moving like avatars in a hyper-modern landscape. True to form, Coperni’s AW25 Paris Fashion Week show is no ordinary catwalk; it’s a complex commentary on our relationship with technology. Gaming enthusiasts and digital futurists sit shoulder-to-shoulder, immersed in a world where fashion meets the tech frontier. At the center of it all? The Ray-Ban Meta x Coperni limited-edition Wayfarers–AI-powered smart glasses that allow the wearer to capture photos hands-free, translate speech in real-time, and seamlessly integrate the digital with the physical. It’s a bold vision of what’s to come: fashion that doesn’t just dress the body, but enhances the way we interact with the world around us.Coperni has built its reputation on moments like this. From that viral spray-on dress – applied directly onto Bella Hadid’s body on the runway to its Air Swipe bag made from NASA-developed silica aerogel, the brand is relentlessly pushing the boundaries of what fashion can be. And Coperni isn’t alone. Houses like Gucci, Valentino, and Moncler are racing toward the future too, using AI-generated campaign imagery, creating NFTs to sell in Web3, and launching personal shopping tools that leverage ChatGPT. These activations have been eye-opening and provocative, offering glimpses of a high-tech fashion future, but they’ve sometimes run the risk of feeling gimmicky—more spectacle than substance.River Callaway//Getty ImagesThe Coperni autumn/winter 2025 showBy contrast, many of fashion’s most storied houses, particularly those under the LVMH umbrella, have taken a more measured approach. Rather than chasing social media’s ephemeral ‘viral moment,’ they’ve integrated AI and digital tools in ‘quiet’ ways that feel almost invisible to the average consumer. “Luxury is about appreciation of product quality and craftsmanship,” says Gonzague De Pirey, the chief omnichannel and data officer at LVMH. “Tech and innovation are not a goal in themselves; they are in service of our mission.” This philosophy prioritizes refinement over drama, ensuring that technology works behind the scenes to enhance, rather than distract from, the luxury shopping experience.So, what does this mean for the future of luxury shopping? How does AI elevate, rather than cheapen, the most exclusive retail experiences in the world? If the latest developments are anything to go by, the answer lies in ‘quiet tech’—subtle but game-changing innovations that work behind the seams to make everything feel smoother, more personal, and effortlessly luxurious.1. Online shopping will be curated by a stylist …just not a human one. Luxury eCommerce is in the middle of an AI-powered glow-up. If you’ve ever browsed sites like Net-a-Porter, Moda Operandi, or Farfetch, you’ve probably noticed the slow shift towards hyper-personalized shopping. But in the next five years, AI will take things up several notches.Expect virtual try-ons that actually work (goodbye, awkward AR filters), AI-driven styling services that learn your taste over time, and predictive inventory that ensures the pieces you love are never unavailable in your size. Net-a-Porter, for example, has been experimenting with AI-powered personal shoppers that can refine recommendations based on past purchases and browsing behavior. Moda Operandi is using machine learning to predict emerging trends before they explode, helping buyers snap up exclusive pieces before they become impossible to find.And let’s not forget about Farfetch, which is leading the charge in AI-driven logistics — meaning faster deliveries, smarter stock distribution, and a more seamless checkout experience. The goal? A shopping journey that feels almost psychic in its ability to understand what you want before you even know it yourself.2. Your in-store assistant will feel like your best friendLuxury shopping has always been about VIP treatment. The held-open doors, a whiff of rich leather, a glass of champagne while you browse and somebody helpfully carrying your pieces to the changing room for you. As counterintuitive as it might sound, the teams at many leading luxury brands are focused on getting more people offline and back into the practice of shopping in brick-and-mortar stores, by making it an enriching and unforgettable experience. At LVMH, AI-powered clienteling apps help sales associates anticipate a VIP’s preferences before they even step foot in ",
