Your ChatGPT Business Case?The Importance of Prompt Engineering and the Future of GPT Models We will send you an email with the link to the requested file GPT models weren’t widely popular until November 2022, once OpenAI built a successor of their language models called ChatGPT. As for March 2023 ChatGPT is now officially released with an API and SDK to integrate the model into your products. While there are a plethora of applications on the surface, ChatGPT offers a wide range of improvements for different types of technical and business processes. So here we’ll put to the test the most viable, and see where it gets us. I’ll share with you my vision on how we can benefit from GPT models on different levels of automation, while providing you with a concise answer of the question, “What do I need to implement a GPT model in my product?”. Please note: all the tests were made during the pre-release stage. What is ChatGPT and What are GPT Models in General? If you already know what ChatGPT and other GPT models are, you can skip this part. Because here I’ll define ChatGPT from different angles, along with how to exploit its capabilities to dig for data and provide us with necessary information. The easiest way to do this is by simply asking the model, and here is how ChatGPT identifies itself: ChatGPT defines itself ChatGPT is the latest GPT model that was developed on the basis of GPT 3.5. It has the ability to interact with the user in the form of a dialogue and provide answers to almost any question based on events and information up until 2021. GPT models are highly capable of solving a range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks with the possibility of customization such as: Keywords extraction Text translation Question answering Text generation Text summary Spelling correction Text style transferring Named entity recognition How to Use ChatGPT in Your App or Website As of March 2023, ChatGPT is available via API and some companies like Snapchat are already using it. So it makes sense to discuss how ChatGPT can be integrated in your application for a technical standpoint. There is a certain fork of options here: 1. The task is viable by means of the existing model. Here, the model operates as a smart catalog, helping the user to browse through content and make choices more quickly using the response of GPT. However, customizations and personalization are not available. 2. Fine-tuning the model with your own data. Such models can be useful for creating a personalized chatbot recommender system based on user actions/desires and other use cases. Using your own data, the GPT model can be trained to introduce the element of personalization. The amount of data needed to fine tune a GPT model depends on various factors, such as the size and complexity of the data set, and the desired performance of the model. Typically, at least a few hundred examples are required to effectively fine-tune a GPT model. However, in complex domains, it may take tens of thousands or even millions of examples to achieve optimal model performance. To understand whether you’ll need to fine-tune the model, I would recommend you running through these 5 steps: Business understanding that involves learning the business case, what task is delegated to the model, what data it should use, and the personalization features that are expected. Data gathering. This step can be skipped if personalized information can be skipped at the early stages. But if you plan to use the GPT model in a highly specific domain, by default, the model will fail to operate correctly. Which means, this stage is necessary. For example, it is necessary to recommend clothes for the user based on what is available in the store. Then it is necessary to collect information about the products of the store and provide basic instructions for recommendations (for example, jeans with the article YYYY should be worn over a T-shirt with such XXXX). Data annotation/Data labeling. This stage will include creating a prompt for each sample from the data gathering stage. For example: shorts with YYYY articles must be worn over a T-shirt with XXXX article = what should I wear under a T-shirt with XXX article? And the expected answer: jeans with YYYY article. Data Preparation. This implies converting the data into a suitable format, e.g. “{“prompt”: “<what should I wear under a T-shirt with article XXX?>”, “completion”: “<Shorts with article YYYY>”}”.
