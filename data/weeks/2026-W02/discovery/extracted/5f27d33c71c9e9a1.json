Physical retail has had to innovate to evolve to overcome consumer sluggishness, a pandemic, and countless disruptive technologies in the last couple of years alone. The industry’s resilience and progress can largely be attributed to advanced data and predictive analytics systems, which enable data-driven decision-making, strategizing, and, ultimately, overcoming.Internet of Things (IoT) technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) provide valuable store insights. AI gives businesses unparalleled access to high-level organized data, leading to improved retail operations, new business opportunities, and more seamless in-store experiences. It is no wonder that AI has driven an additional estimated $40 billion in revenue for the retail industry over a 3-year period.Now, as physical retail finds its feet and begins surpassing pre-pandemic performance, AI is doing more than simply keeping stores afloat. AI technologies are helping retail businesses become more competitive than ever before.

Technology leaders in this category offer competitive data sets that enable customers to analyze what is working for their competitors at a store level and in their trade areas. This information can be utilized for strategic planning, store operations, real estate, marketing, and more.This level of insight previously required extensive data ingestion and teams of data scientists to comprehend competitive performance, assuming that data was even accessible. Now, with the help of new technologies, this process has been simplified. At pass_by, this is done by measuring foot traffic to thousands of US brands and augmenting the foot traffic with over 10 unique demographic and psychographic datasets to provide unique insights into competitive performance. The newest foot traffic model can overlay intricate psychographic and demographic data onto foot traffic data to offer previously unavailable competitive insights. Previous attempts to do this have often been unreliable, messy, and simply incorrect. This streamlined, ultra-accurate data then enables competitive intelligence across several different teams, from store ops to real estate. Moreover, AI is added into the mix to provide a predictive element to this model, allowing retailers to view forecasts of future performance patterns months into the future.Ultimately, this technology allows retailers to enjoy the same richness of their first-party data, but with regard to their competitors. This presents the new frontier in in-store analytics wherein foot traffic is taken to new heights with a layered look into how competitor brands are performing now and into the future.Empowering Retail WorkersIn the past, obtaining precise predictions and gaining competitive insights would have required a more manual data science approach, likely involving some form of machine learning (ML) and large teams of data scientists. However, with more advanced models, it's possible for the models to 'learn' and use this capability not only to measure more accurately but also to assist retailers in predicting future events. This is where AI can be beneficial in supporting workers’ goals and innovation initiatives.Massively time-consuming tasks like data management and processing can now be executed accurately by AI, thereby lightening the load on the labor force. Critically, AI enables the rapid processing of raw data, making it accessible to workers in a manageable and actionable format. As a result, AI democratizes these once-inaccessible insights and empowers individual stores to compete with some of the largest retailers in the world.For example, AI-processed insights can be shared with store teams ahead of peak shopping periods or key occasions. These learnings and predictions can help brands anticipate which of their stores will see an increase in foot traffic, allowing them to plan ahead and adjust their staff allocation to maximize customer satisfaction.WATCH NOW: Retail Leaders On The Power Of In-Store AnalyticsBusting AI MythsWhenever a new technology is introduced, there has been a heady mix of concern, excitement, and trepidation. From the first factory to the smartphone, innovation ushers in anxiety. AI has not been immune from these reactions. According to Forbes, some key AI concerns are privacy, bias, job displacement, economic inequality, and manipulation.However, AI is central to the evolution of in-store analytics and, in turn, physical retail. AI allows brick-and-mortar stores to stay competitive (with one another and their online counterparts), d",
