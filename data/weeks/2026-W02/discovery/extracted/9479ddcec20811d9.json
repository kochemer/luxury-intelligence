We'll show you how these practical tools deliver immediate support and drive customer success.\n\n* Share the story\n\nWhile [AI for customer service](https://www.salesforce.com/service/ai/) tools have long helped service teams improve efficiency, the technology has evolved significantly from rule-based chatbots to true [AI agents](https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/what-are-ai-agents/). Yesterday's chatbots offered instant support for common issues, but modern AI agents are a revolutionary step forward. By delivering intelligent, context-aware resolutions, agentic AI is the key to unlocking exceptional customer satisfaction and lowering operational costs. Let's explore why this transition from chatbots to AI agents matters for your business.\n\n## What is a customer service chatbot?\n\nThe difference between the two is best understood with an analogy. A traditional [chatbot](https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/chatbot/) is like a vending machine: it works from a fixed menu of pre-defined, scripted responses. It's effective for simple, repetitive tasks but struggles with any request outside its programming.\n\nIn contrast, an AI agent is like a personal chef. It uses large language models to understand complex requests, reason through problems, and ground answers in your company's unique data. An AI agent handles nuanced conversations and seamlessly hands off issues to a human rep when needed, creating a truly natural experience and freeing up your team for the most complex work.\n\n## What you’ll learn about customer service chatbots\n\n* What is a customer service chatbot?\n* Benefits of customer service chatbots\n* Examples of how chatbots are used to improve customer service\n* Important features to look for when choosing an customer service chatbot\n* Tips for creating a customer service chatbot\n* Trends in customer service chatbots\n* What’s the difference between chatbots and AI agents?\n* How Salesforce can help create better customer experiences at scale\n\n## What are the benefits of customer service chatbots?\n\n* Using customer service chatbots is about more than just efficiency — it's about delivering a superior and seamless [customer service experience](https://www.salesforce.com/service/what-is-customer-service-experience/). These tools achieve this for your customers through five key benefits.\n\n### Faster service and higher satisfaction\n\nWhen your customers have a question, the last thing they want to do is wait. Chatbots provide immediate answers, which boosts your [Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT)](https://www.salesforce.com/service/customer-service-incident-management/customer-satisfaction-score/) and leaves customers with a great impression of your brand.\n\n### 24/7 availability and global reach\n\nYour business doesn't stop at 5 p.m., and neither do your customers' questions. Chatbots offer around-the-clock support, ensuring you're always there to help, no matter the time zone. This constant availability makes your business feel more reliable and responsive.\n\n### Consistent and accurate responses\n\nA customer’s trust is hard to win and easy to lose. A chatbot offers consistency because it follows a rigid, preprogrammed script. However, this consistency breaks down when a query falls outside its predefined tracks.   \n  \nIn contrast, an AI agent provides both consistency and flexibility. By pulling from a single, centralized [knowledge management system](https://www.salesforce.com/service/what-is-a-knowledge-management-system/), it can answer a wide range of questions accurately, ensuring reliable support that builds true customer confidence.This means no more conflicting information, just reliable support that builds customer confidence.\n\n### Personalized customer experience\n\nNo one likes to feel like a number. Chatbots can use customer data to provide a personalized experience that feels tailored and engaging. This personal touch shows customers you understand their needs and helps turn a simple inquiry into a loyalty-building moment.\n\n### Quick issue resolution\n\nLet your chatbots handle the simple, everyday questions. This form of [automated customer service](https://www.salesforce.com/service/customer-service-automation/what-is-automated-customer-service/) allows for quick resolution of common issues and frees up your customer service reps to focus on the complex problems where their expertise is truly needed. It’s a win for efficiency and for your team.\n\nRead the latest in customer service research.\n\nTop service teams are using AI and data to win every customer interaction.
