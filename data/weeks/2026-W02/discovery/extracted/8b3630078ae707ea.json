Right now, there's a bit of everything for nearly every productivity problem: from new intelligent features on apps you already love, to entirely new platforms with jaw-dropping functionality.Create an AI digital assistant with ZapierLearn howI've been playing around with AI tools for a while now, and I've continued to update this list with lots of research and testing from me and the team at Zapier.

And the tools I've used for years—like Notion, Canva, Grammarly, and (against my will) Microsoft—have added AI features and assistants to their platforms. To be fully transparent, I haven't gotten around to testing every single AI tool on the market, mostly because it would be easier to count the glitter particles left over after a kindergarten art project. But I'm doing my best to make a dent in the ever-growing list. The list you're about to see contains a collection of great AI productivity tools tested by Zapier's app review team, myself included. If there's a particular category you like, check out the best apps lists we've put together for them.While all these apps are getting better every day, they're far from perfect: be sure to always check AI's work with your human brain. With that being said, please keep all hands and legs inside the vehicle—it's time to explore.1. Apps for AI orchestration and automationAI tools are great at individual tasks, but the real magic happens when you can connect them together. In fact, 78% of enterprises are struggling to integrate AI with their current tech stacks, which is why your first stop should be choosing an AI orchestration layer that can coordinate how all your apps, data, and AI tools interact so your work actually flows.ZapierZapier is built to help your tools and AI work together seamlessly across 8,000+ apps. It's a hub that lets you do everything from analyzing business data with AI to creating entire automated systems that react instantly (and intelligently) to real-time triggers.Zapier's AI productivity features include:Copilot: your natural language builder for automation. Describe what you want to happen (\"summarize new leads in Slack every morning\"), and Copilot will draft a complete workflow, then connect your accounts, map the data, and even test each step automatically.AI by Zapier: built-in access to ChatGPT with no API key required.

You can even use the Chrome extension to trigger them from anywhere on the web.Chatbots by Zapier: custom, no-code bots trained on your own content—like a help center or website—that can answer questions, guide customers, or handle internal requests. You can set them to automatically check for new updates so they always stay current.Tables: a flexible, spreadsheet-style database that lets you store, organize, and update the data your automations and AI agents rely on.
