These components of AI tools come in different shapes and sizes, allowing businesses to handle many daily tasks. LLMs are a common component of many AI-based products in e-commerce, healthcare, education, and financial sectors.The increasing popularity of these tools leads many companies to consider LLM integration strategies. While the need for large language models is ever-increasing, only a few enterprises fully grasp the technology behind them or how successful implementation puts them at an advantage. What are Large Language Models?LLMs are advanced ML models that understand and produce human language. We have already discussed in our blog: what is LLM and how it works, so today we will talk about the necessity of LLM in today’s business operations. LLMs use vast amounts of text information to find patterns and comprehend language structures to achieve this.Currently, there are two main types of LLMs: closed-source, like GPT, and open-source - such as LLama 2. They come in different dataset sizes and encompass vast volumes of information scraped from the web. Some are pre-trained in specific knowledge to offer better assistance in sensitive fields such as finances and healthcare.However, businesses often turn to AI programmers capable of fine-tuning LLMs to make the tools answer specific questions. Large language models are usually integrated into products like AI chatbots, AI assistants, recommendation systems, and others. Many companies even add them to recruitment and training systems to better identify and onboard candidates.Latest LLM StatisticsLarge language models integration profoundly affected the business world in 2023. The latest statistics show how they improved the daily operations of enterprises in different sectors of the economy:By the end of 2023, the global market for LLMs reached $4,35 billion. Between 2024 and 2030, it’s expected to grow at a 35,9% CAGR. These statistics show that over 300 million companies globally won't lose interest in this technology this year.Why Do Companies Integrate LLMs?One of the main reasons for the success and adoption rates of LLM products is the fact that it’s a new type of technology that has already made waves in various industries. They experience particular popularity among enterprises working with commercial clients. Large language models open a new age of automation and productivity for companies.Despite the novelty of these products, many companies already use them for various internal and external processes. These include Amazon, Facebook, Google, IBM, and Microsoft. In addition to big names, LLMs are a common component in conversational tools smaller companies use for customer support.According to the latest statistics, 23% of worldwide companies plan to deploy commercial LLMs or have already done so. Moreover, 58% of enterprises experiment with working with LLMs. Most likely, the integration rates will increase this year. LLM products are more robust and safer than ever, and with the wide availability of tools, enterprises will be more open-minded about this process. Main Benefits Of LLM IntegrationLarge language models aren’t just a gimmick that helps chatbots produce more accurate responses.
