As Henry Ford famously said, “They can have any color they want…as long as it’s black!” The market was driven by costs, and why not? Businesses had very little idea what customers really wanted. The advertising industry was in its infancy – the concept or talking to customers at all was little known. Step forward to today and Henry Ford would be shocked. Not only is customer communication now a two-way street but individualizing products at an affordable price is now a reality for many product lines. The level of change will only accelerate from here. Let’s discuss three areas where the impact is greatest – one you will be very aware of; one you have become recently aware of and one you may not know at all. The Shift to Online Retail Over the past five years, we’ve seen a substantial shift in consumer behavior. In 2020, e-commerce sales surged by 44%—the highest growth rate in over two decades. As of 2023, online retail now accounts for approximately 21% of total retail sales in the U.S. This shift is reshaping the traditional brick-and-mortar experience. Many are investing in their online presence, offering click-and-collect services or enhancing their delivery options to compete with giants like Amazon. The retail landscape is becoming more integrated, with physical and online stores working together to provide seamless experiences. Those who have not started to build a stronger online shopping and social media presence will be left behind. The Rise of AI in Retail AI may seem like a buzzword right now, but it has huge potential to impact how your customers’ shop. From personalized recommendations to chatbots that provide customer support, AI is enhancing the shopping experience in ways you might not even realize. Online retailers like Amazon have long used the “recommended for you” concept to suggest additional products at checkout but this will only grow further and become more tailored as AI is added to the mix. According to recent research, around 70% of consumers expect personalized experiences when shopping online. Retailers are responding by utilizing AI to analyze vast amounts of data, allowing them to tailor offers and promotions to individual preferences. This personalization will not only improve your customer’s shopping experience but will also boost sales and profits for retailer’s savvy enough to join in. Blockchain: The Future of Transparency While blockchain is often associated with cryptocurrencies, its potential in retail is intriguing. Blockchain is a system of recording transactions and other information across a series of computers, making it easy to trace the chain of activity from source to end use. It has the potential to allow consumers to trace the journey of your product from the manufacturer to your doorstep. Blockchain technology offers a level of transparency that, for consumers, means knowing exactly where your product comes from and ensuring that it’s ethically sourced. According to a study, around 57% of consumers are willing to change their shopping habits to help reduce negative environmental impact. Blockchain can play a significant role here by providing verifiable information about a product’s supply chain. This transparency can build trust and loyalty, essential for retailers looking to thrive in a competitive market.So, what does the future hold? Expect to see even more integration of AI and blockchain in retail. AI will continue to enhance personalization, while blockchain will likely push for greater transparency, accountability and ethical practices. As online retail grows, traditional stores will adapt by creating unique experiences that keep customers coming back. Despite the ‘negative’ trend towards online the future of instore experiences can still be bright if handled correctly. A recent report found that 75% of consumers still prefer to shop in physical stores for certain categories, such as groceries and luxury items. This means that while online shopping is convenient, there’s still a strong desire for the tactile experience that physical stores offer. The future of instore retail will belong to those who can harness this desire. Industry Insight for Retail Jewelers: For retail jewelers, the future of retail means embracing new tools while preserving what makes jewelry unique. Online platforms and AI can help attract new buyers and personalize recommendations, while blockchain builds trust by verifying diamond and gemstone sourcing. Yet, the in-store experience remains essential as customers still seek the expertise and service jewelers provide.
