In the ever-evolving landscape of Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO), one trend stands out as a game-changer: hyper-personalization. With the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI), businesses are now capable of creating highly individualized experiences that go beyond simple demographic-based targeting.
