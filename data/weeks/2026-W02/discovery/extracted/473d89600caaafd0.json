In the competitive landscape of modern business, adopting AI-driven knowledge management systems has transitioned from a luxury to a fundamental necessity.The incorporation of Large Language Models (LLMs) into business frameworks is becoming an increasingly vital strategy for organizations aiming to stay at the forefront of technological advancement.This integration serves a fundamental role in the existing corporate landscape. The requirement for LLM integration stems from its potential to transform knowledge management processes, encompassing the creation, capture, and organization of information that cannot be efficiently done through traditional approaches.It enables businesses to empower their employees by providing faster access to knowledge. Furthermore, it significantly boosts customer service quality through personalized and efficient interactions. LLMs offer deep data insights which are crucial for informed decision-making and strategy development. In terms of content, they are capable of generating a vast array of materials ranging from reports to creative content, thereby streamlining the content creation workflow.Customizing LLMs for Business NeedsThe customization of LLMs for specific business needs involves techniques such as prompt engineering, finetuning, retrieval augment generation (RAG), and integration of knowledge graphs (KGs) into LLMs, allowing these models to be tailored to specific industry requirements. Since pre-training a large language model requires massive datasets and extensive computing resources, it is beyond the capabilities of most businesses. However, businesses can finetune the foundation models on their specific datasets to turn them into domain-specific LLMs.Pre-training vs. finetuning. Most businesses cannot afford to train their own large language model. Although finetuning is an option for creating domain-specific LLMs, it requires additional expertise and constant finetuning for new data. Image by author.Prompt engineering is the most basic approach that companies can adopt for LLM integration. This approach requires crafting the most appropriate prompt (or a chain of prompts) along with a context that represents the company’s data, style, format, role, examples, and/or limitations. This approach can suffice for most business tasks; however, it is limited by the context size of LLMs. Although current LLMs have a very large context window, business data can exceed the context window. In addition, using a very large context is an expensive and inefficient approach.Press enter or click to view image in full sizePrompt engineering: It’s all about crafting prompt(s) and setting the right context. However, a very large context is not only expensive but is also inefficient. Image by author.Retrieval Augment Generation (RAG) is a more practical approach in which the business data is stored in a specialized database, called a vector database. The data in the vector database is stored in the form of chunks (vectors), with semantically similar chunks placed adjacent to each other. The user query is matched with the vector database to fetch the top semantically similar chunks. These chunks are then sent to the LLM along with the prompt. The LLM picks the most suitable chunk in the context of the prompt and produces the final output.Press enter or click to view image in full sizeRetrieval Augment Generation (RAG) — a more practical approach to integrate business data into LLMs and mitigate hallucinations. However, it can only handle simple queries and fails to understand the query context and semantic relationships of data items. Figure inspired by Better RAG 1: Advanced Basics (huggingface.co)Knowledge Graphs offer a comprehensive and interconnected framework for organizing and analyzing an organization’s data, encompassing employee information, roles, skills, and overarching organizational needs. These graphs are constructed atop the existing data repositories of an organization and can integrate both structured and unstructured data. This approach not only enhances the accessibility and usability of data but also facilitates deeper insights into the workforce and operational dynamics, empowering organizations to make more informed decisions.Press enter or click to view image in full sizeInterpretation of a simple knowledge graph. Knowledge graph provides enhanced reasoning and can answer complex questions that require understanding the semantic relationships among data items. Image by author.KGs provide enhanced reasoning capabilities. While RAGs with vector databases are good for recommendations and matchmaking platforms, the RAGs with KG are not only good for these tasks but are also suitable for answering complex, multi-hop questions that may require referring to multiple documents.
