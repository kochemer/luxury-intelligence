AI can enhance retail accuracy by optimizing inventory management, customer insights, operational efficiency, and price optimization. These improvements can lead to reduced stockouts, increased sales conversion, decreased operational costs, and improved customer satisfaction. Companies are working to find ways that they can be more efficient and improve operations through the use of AI. This effort is reflected in the fact that nine out of 10 companies now utilize AI or are assessing the possibility for use of AI, often fueled by advanced data and predictive analytics. Jeff Vagg, Chief Data and Analytics Officer at North says, “AI isn’t just about automation. It is about enabling real-time intelligence across the business. But it only works if the data is there to support it. For retailers and small-to-medium businesses (SMBs), quality data is the engine, and AI is what turns it into faster decisions, sharper customer insight, and the agility to compete in a dynamic market.” Advances in POS systems, often powered by the Internet of Things (IoT) and AI, can now provide retailers with invaluable insights, leading to operational improvements and the creation of new revenue streams—an estimated $40 billion over just four years.Challenges and opportunities For SMBs and larger retailers alike, AI presents both significant opportunities and real challenges. While adoption can seem daunting due to perceived costs and complexity, the potential benefits—like enhanced customer experiences, streamlined operations, and increased competitiveness—are substantial. However, it's important to recognize that AI, particularly Generative AI, is still very much in development and not yet always reliable. There is a wide range of accuracy levels across generative AI tools, and recent studies have highlighted notable shortcomings. A 2025 study found that among queries made of eight major generative search engines, the average error rate was as high as 60%. For example, Perplexity answered 37% of queries incorrectly, while Grok 3 had an error rate of 94%. Chatbots across the board were often “confidently wrong,” sometimes failing to retrieve the correct information or citations. Not every AI tool lives up to its promise, therefore, businesses should carefully weigh the opportunities and risks of using AI to determine if it's a good fit.Overall benefits of AI AI can offer many benefits for the retail and SMB sectors, such as:Improving the customer experience: Through personalized interactions and marketing.Streamlining operations: By automating routine tasks and optimizing inventory.Driving sales: Via targeted advertising and dynamic pricing.Enhancing decision-making: With data analysis and business intelligence.According to NVIDIA, 82% of retailers are either utilizing or evaluating generative AI, and over half have already integrated it into their production processes. Retailers can significantly improve inventory management by using AI to assess historical sales trends along with external variables like weather conditions, local events, and global trade rules. This evaluation allows businesses to make strategic decisions about product stocking, so they can effectively meet customer demand and optimize inventory levels.Key areas to leverage AIPersonalized customer experiencesAI is reshaping how retailers interact with customers by creating tailored experiences that drive engagement and loyalty. Let's take a closer look at how personalization is transforming the retail landscape. Personal recommendationsAI analyzes customer data, including browsing and purchase history, to provide personalized product suggestions and tailored offers. This level of personalization enhances cross-selling and upselling opportunities, making the shopping experience more engaging and relevant for each customer. By understanding individual preferences and behaviors, businesses can craft offers that resonate with consumers, ultimately driving higher sales and customer satisfaction.AI-powered customer serviceIn today's competitive market, exceptional customer service is a key differentiator. AI-driven solutions can offer innovative ways to enhance service delivery and facilitate customer satisfaction. Optimized operations and efficiencyThe 2025 NVIDIA report states the evaluation and adoption of AI in retail continues to grow, with 89% of respondents in 2024 reporting that their company either actively uses or is in the process of assessing AI for potential use. This is an increase from 82% in 2023. aPotential benefits of AI include streamlining processes and optimizing resource allocation. For example, AI-driven demand ",
