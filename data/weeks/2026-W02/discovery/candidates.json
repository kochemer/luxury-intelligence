In new research from Google and Vogue Business, they share the latest opportunities in AI for fashion and luxury brands, and how new technologies are changing purchasing behaviours.An AI revolution is underway in the world of fashion. New tools, powered by AI, are transforming how retailers are personalising the shopping journey to make the consumer’s life easier. AI is also helping fashion brands design new products, and cut down on waste.New research from Vogue Business reveals how AI is changing consumers’ purchasing behaviours in Europe. Consumers are eager for an AI-led shopping experience — two thirds of respondents said they are “somewhat excited” or “very excited” for designer fashion brands to introduce more AI applications in the next 1-3 years.1They are even willing to spend more with retailers who have used AI tools for product personalisation, to improve the shopping experience online, and to develop sustainable practices. Nearly three in 10 (29%) are willing to spend an extra 20% or more with a brand that uses AI applications.2Here’s how retailers can successfully embrace these tools to meet the consumer needs of today — and reap higher returns at the same time.Boosting the customer experience with AIEver since the introduction of online shopping, the fashion industry has sought to bridge the gap between the in-store experience — where shoppers are able to search through store racks and physically try on items to find the perfect fit — and online. Forty-three per cent of consumers said they would be prepared to spend at least 10% more on personalised shopping online.3AI is already present at several touchpoints on the customer journey. Fashion retailers are able to incorporate AI tools to reflect the in-store experience to the online shopper. Visual search tools like Google Lens mean consumers no longer need to rely on product descriptors, but instead search with what the item actually looks like.Once the shopper has found their perfect designer dress, augmented reality (AR) try-on tools adopted by retailers can allow the shopper to ensure the right fit and style. These tools resonate well: 49% of luxury consumers think that brands using AI offer a better experience.4 But there is great potential for even more advanced uses of AI tools.Tommaso Vaccarella is co-founder and general manager at Connected-Stories, a creative personalisation platform, driven by AI. Connected-Stories uses generative AI models to optimise the ad creative production process for brands across several industry verticals, including a number of fashion brands.He says: “The industry can use generative AI models to personalise the consumer experience throughout the entire consumer journey, not just at the first touchpoint.”Consumers of luxury brands want a VIP experience — in-store they are accustomed to personal shoppers and glamorous outlets. Now, AI is helping marketers provide the same level of personalisation for their customers online.AI at the heart of e-commerce personalisationResearch shows that using generative AI tools to create personalised deals, offers, and recommendations on products has a positive impact on fashion consumers' purchase motivations. More than three in ten (31%) consumers are willing to spend up to 20% more for a brand that does this.5From the use of generative AI to craft engaging storytelling in marketing communications, to the use of AI to generate personalised ads across platforms, retailers have enhanced opportunities to connect with consumers — and drive revenue.Italian fashion retailer Benetton used browsing and purchasing data to provide personalised product recommendations to customers with Recommendations AI. They found the average spending value of customers using the tool was 7% higher, and the time spent on the site almost tripled, compared to those who did not interact with the tool.Connected-Stories is built on Google Cloud. The platform utilises machine learning models with their clients, including a number of fashion brands, to allow for ad creatives to be automated, personalised, and delivered to users in real time.Vaccarella explains: “Based on data such as consumer shopping habits and interests, the time of day, and even geolocation and weather conditions, the right audience will see the right creative ad, which has been AI generated using brands' creative guidelines such as color, tone of voice, image styles, graphics usage, and more.“For example, you might find that a certain type of backdrop on your ad r",

Using that insight, an AI model for jewelry adjusts CAD templates on the fly, recommending millimeter-level tweaks that match the forecast. Designers keep the artistic vision, yet product teams move from sketch to prototype in days instead of weeks.Generative networks go a step further. Feed a rough sketch or a gemstone specification into platforms like Autodesk Dreamcatcher, and the software produces dozens of weight-optimized silhouettes ready for 3D printing. Because these AI models for jewelry incorporate historical sales data, they flag concepts likely to underperform before precious metals hit the casting floor.Manufacturing lines benefit, too. Computer-vision inspectors catch micro-fractures in stones as small as 0.02 mm, while reinforcement-learning bots schedule furnace cycles to balance throughput with energy costs. Each upgrade tightens quality control without adding headcount.Legal questions haven’t disappeared. When an algorithm draws on a global image corpus, authorship can blur.

From personalized recommendations to smart inventory forecasting, AI gives jewelry retailers a competitive edge—especially those working in fast-moving categories like stainless steel, fashion, and trend-driven pieces. Whether you operate a brick-and-mortar store or sell online, leveraging AI tools can dramatically increase your sales in 2025 and beyond. Let’s explore the most powerful AI strategies for retail jewelry brands and how to implement them. AI-Powered Virtual Try-On & Visual Tools Augmented reality and AI are changing the way customers shop for jewelry—especially online. By offering virtual try-on features, brands can build shopper confidence, increase engagement, and reduce returns. How Virtual Try-On Increases Jewelry Sales AI and AR-powered tools allow shoppers to \"try on\" rings, earrings, necklaces, and bracelets using just their smartphone or laptop camera. These tools use computer vision to detect facial features and hand shapes, rendering realistic previews of how pieces will look when worn. Not only do virtual try-ons reduce return rates, they also enhance conversion by making the experience more interactive. This is especially effective for trend-driven pieces like oversized hoops or statement necklaces—where visual appeal drives the purchase decision. Enhancing Product Visualization with AI Beyond virtual try-on, AI can generate 3D product visualizations that allow customers to rotate and zoom in on jewelry pieces. These features are crucial for fashion jewelry and stainless steel accessories where texture, shine, and styling are key selling points. Chatbots & AI-Powered Customer Support Exceptional customer service is a major driver of retail sales—and AI can help you deliver it at scale. Smart chatbots and AI-driven help desks can answer customer questions in real time, no matter the hour. 24/7 AI Chatbots for Retail Jewelry Stores AI chatbots are now sophisticated enough to handle inquiries about product details, shipping, sizing, and even style recommendations. This technology is especially useful for online wholesale jewelry brands where high product volume and frequent customer inquiries can strain human support teams. AI bots can help customers choose the right chain length, identify matching earrings, or resolve pre-sale concerns instantly—leading to more conversions with less friction. Sentiment Analysis & Post-Purchase Support AI can also analyze reviews, returns, and chat transcripts to detect patterns and common customer issues. Sentiment analysis allows brands to proactively fix problems, respond to negative experiences, and improve satisfaction—all of which help drive long-term sales. Predictive Analytics & Inventory Optimization Retail jewelry brands—especially wholesalers—need to manage stock levels carefully. AI predictive analytics help forecast demand, reduce overstock, and ensure top-selling items are always available. Forecasting Trends Before They Happen AI tools analyze customer behavior, historical sales, seasonal shifts, and even fashion trend data to anticipate future demand. For example, if AI detects growing interest in layered stainless steel necklaces or zodiac-themed charm bracelets, your team can increase orders and marketing efforts in advance. This demand forecasting reduces inventory waste and helps you stay ahead of seasonal trends—critical for success in fast-moving categories like fashion jewelry. Smarter Merchandising with AI Insights Clienteling tools powered by AI help retailers connect with past buyers by recommending products they're likely to purchase next. These tools allow in-store associates and e-commerce platforms to suggest products based on purchase history, preferences, and browsing behavior—leading to more personalized upsells and stronger customer loyalty. Personalized Marketing & Recommendation Engines Consumers expect personalization—and AI makes it scalable. From product recommendations to targeted email campaigns, AI lets you market the right product to the right customer at the right time. AI Product Recommendations That Drive Sales Recommendation engines analyze customer data—such as product views, abandoned carts, and wishlist activity—to suggest jewelry pieces that align with each shopper’s tastes. These tools can dynamically update homepage displays, shopping carts, or follow-up emails to boost conversion rates. A shopper who browses stainless steel rings in gold tones might be shown coordinating earrings or layered bracelets that complete the look. These relevant suggestions increase average order value and reduce bounce rates. AI Marketing in Action: A Real Retail Example Brands like Kendra Scott use AI “copilot” tools to ans",

In the fast-paced world of ecommerce, artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming a game-changer, particularly in niche markets like jewelry. From enhancing customer experiences to optimizing business operations, AI is transforming the way jewelry is bought and sold online. Personalized Shopping ExperiencesAI algorithms analyze customer behavior, preferences, and purchase history to offer personalized shopping experiences. By understanding individual tastes, AI can recommend products that a customer is more likely to purchase. This not only improves customer satisfaction but also increases conversion rates. For example, if a customer frequently browses vintage-style rings, the AI system will highlight similar items, making the shopping experience more tailored and engaging.Virtual Try-OnsOne of the biggest challenges in online jewelry shopping is the inability to try on pieces before buying. AI-powered virtual try-on tools are changing this by allowing customers to see how a piece of jewelry looks on them through augmented reality (AR). By using their smartphone or computer cameras, customers can virtually try on rings, necklaces, and earrings, reducing the hesitation to buy and increasing confidence in their purchases.Chatbots and Customer ServiceAI-driven chatbots are enhancing customer service by providing instant responses to inquiries. Available 24/7, these chatbots can answer common questions, guide users through the purchase process, and even offer personalized recommendations. This immediate assistance improves customer satisfaction and frees up human customer service representatives to handle more complex issues.Inventory ManagementEfficient inventory management is crucial for any ecommerce business. AI helps by predicting trends and managing stock levels. By analyzing sales data and market trends, AI can forecast which items will be in demand and ensure that popular products are always in stock. This prevents overstocking or stockouts, optimizing inventory levels and reducing costs.Pricing OptimizationAI algorithms can analyze competitor pricing, demand, and other market factors to suggest optimal pricing for jewelry products. This dynamic pricing strategy helps businesses stay competitive while maximizing profits. By adjusting prices in real-time based on various factors, AI ensures that the pricing is always in line with market conditions.Fraud DetectionOnline transactions are prone to fraud, and jewelry ecommerce is no exception. AI systems can detect fraudulent activities by analyzing transaction patterns and identifying anomalies. This helps in preventing fraud and ensuring a secure shopping environment for customers.Visual SearchVisual search technology allows customers to upload images of jewelry pieces they like and find similar items in the online store. AI analyzes the uploaded images and matches them with products in the inventory, making it easier for customers to find exactly what they are looking for. This feature is particularly useful for customers who are inspired by images they find on social media.Enhanced Product DescriptionsAI can generate detailed and accurate product descriptions by analyzing various attributes of the jewelry pieces. This not only saves time for ecommerce businesses but also ensures that descriptions are consistent and informative. Enhanced product descriptions help customers make informed purchasing decisions and improve SEO, driving more traffic to the website.AI offers numerous benefits that enhance both the customer experience and business efficiency. As technology continues to evolve, we can expect even more innovative AI-driven solutions to emerge, further transforming the jewelry ecommerce landscape.Embrace AI in your jewelry ecommerce strategy to stay ahead of the curve and provide your customers with an exceptional shopping experience.

The jewelry industry is on the cusp of a revolution, driven by technological advancements, shifting consumer behaviors, and evolving business strategies. As we delve into the top 5 CRM jewelry trends of 2025, it’s essential to understand the context in which these trends are emerging. The digital transformation of luxury retail has been accelerating, with online sales projected to continue growing. In this landscape, Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems are no longer a nice-to-have, but a must-have for jewelry businesses aiming to thrive. In this section, we’ll explore the evolving landscape of jewelry CRM, discussing why it’s critical for businesses in 2025 and setting the stage for the top trends that will shape the industry’s future. The Digital Transformation of Luxury Retail The jewelry industry has undergone a significant transformation in recent years, shifting from traditional brick-and-mortar stores to omnichannel experiences. According to a report by McKinsey, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated digital adoption in luxury retail, with online sales increasing by 50% in 2020 alone. This trend is expected to continue, with 70% of luxury consumers now using online channels to research and purchase luxury goods. Post-pandemic, customer expectations have changed drastically, with consumers demanding seamless online-offline integration in jewelry retail. A study by Bain & Company found that 60% of luxury consumers expect a personalized experience across all touchpoints, including online, social media, and in-store. To meet these expectations, jewelry retailers must invest in digital technologies, such as e-commerce platforms, social media, and data analytics tools, to create a cohesive and engaging customer experience. Digital adoption rates in luxury retail have increased by 30% since 2020, with online sales accounting for 20% of total sales in the jewelry industry. 80% of luxury consumers use social media to discover new brands and products, highlighting the importance of social media marketing in jewelry retail. A seamless online-offline integration is crucial, with 70% of consumers expecting a consistent experience across all channels, including online, mobile, and in-store. By embracing digital transformation and investing in technologies that enable seamless online-offline integration, jewelry retailers can meet the evolving expectations of their customers, drive sales, and stay competitive in a rapidly changing market. We here at SuperAGI have seen this trend firsthand, and are committed to helping jewelry retailers thrive in this new landscape. Why CRM is Critical for Jewelry Businesses in 2025 The jewelry retail industry presents a unique set of challenges, including high-value purchases, emotional significance, and long purchase cycles. These factors make it crucial for jewelry businesses to invest in sophisticated CRM systems that can help them build strong relationships with customers and drive long-term growth. According to a study by Bain & Company, customer retention rates in the jewelry sector are significantly lower than in other retail segments, with an average retention rate of 20-30% compared to 50-60% in other industries. However, when jewelry businesses are able to retain customers, the payoff can be substantial. A study by McKinsey & Company found that the lifetime value of a customer in the jewelry sector can be up to 5 times higher than in other retail segments. This highlights the importance of implementing effective CRM strategies to nurture customer relationships and encourage repeat business. To achieve this, jewelry businesses can leverage CRM systems to gain a deeper understanding of their customers’ preferences, behaviors, and purchase histories. By analyzing this data, businesses can create personalized marketing campaigns, offer tailored recommendations, and provide exceptional customer service. Some key statisti",

But today, it’s undergoing a massive shift thanks to advanced technologies. From how pieces are designed to how they’re sold, tech is disrupting every aspect of this multi-billion-dollar industry. Innovations such as AI, AR, blockchain, and IoT are not just trends but long-term game changers. The integration of technology doesn’t mean the art of jewelry is lost. Rather, it enhances creativity, increases operational efficiency, and elevates customer experiences. With consumer behavior becoming more digital-first, jewelry businesses need to adapt to this transformation or risk falling behind. Digital Transformation Decades ago, jewelers relied solely on handcrafting and word-of-mouth marketing. But the early 2000s introduced CAD and e-commerce, initiating the first wave of digital change. In the 2010s, social media and mobile apps brought jewelers closer to consumers. Today, we’re in the era of AI, blockchain, and immersive tech.

    "extractedText": "In a world where visual appeal drives buyer decisions, jewelers can no longer afford to rely solely on craftsmanship to stand out. The new competitive edge? Artificial Intelligence (AI). While AI might sound futuristic, it’s quickly becoming a must-have tool for independent jewelers looking to elevate their sales strategy, streamline their workflows, and captivate customers with breathtaking visuals. Are you leveraging AI to its full potential? Here’s how some of the industry’s top jewelers are using AI to drive sales — and how you can, too. 1. Transform Your Product Photography with AI In jewelry retail, visuals are everything. AI-powered photography tools now make it effortless to produce flawless, studio-quality images with just a click. Tools like GemCam Pro and GemLightbox streamline the entire photography process, from automatic lighting adjustment to background removal. Imagine capturing perfect shots of diamonds, gemstones, and intricate pieces without needing a photography team. AI handles the lighting balance, focus, and background cleanup for you — ensuring every image looks consistently polished and high-end. This not only elevates your brand image but also reduces return rates by setting accurate buyer expectations. 2. Streamline Workflows with Intelligent Automation Photography is just one part of the content creation process. Think about the hours spent editing, resizing, renaming, and uploading photos. AI can automate these tedious steps, freeing you up to focus on what truly matters — selling your jewelry. With the Gemlightbox Elite Kit, you can capture four images and one 360° video with a single click. AI then automatically generates product descriptions for your e-commerce store. Even e-commerce catalogs that help you sell directly to the client with personalised branding now only takes one click. What once took hours can now be done in minutes, enabling you to push more content faster and maintain a consistent look across all platforms. 3. Data-Driven Decisions for Smarter Sales AI isn’t just about photos — it’s about insights. Imagine knowing which products are most likely to sell based on customer engagement data. AI tools can analyze viewer interactions, social media engagement, and sales data to reveal which items are generating the most interest. Armed with this data, jewelers can adjust marketing strategies, highlight trending pieces, and launch targeted campaigns that speak directly to customer preferences — all without the guesswork. 4. Seamless Brand Presentation Across Channels Maintaining a consistent look across your website, Etsy shop, and Instagram feed can be a challenge. AI makes it easier to standardize how your products appear across all platforms—ensuring each item reflects the same polish, lighting, and clarity, no matter where it’s viewed. Brand consistency improves recognition and credibility. In fact, businesses that present their brand consistently across all channels see up to 33% more revenue than those that don’t. For jewelers, that can translate into higher trust, better customer retention, and more repeat sales. Introducing a New Era in Jewelry Photography As AI continues to shape the future of the jewelry industry. Jewelers, diamond and gemstones dealers now have access to tools that combine automation, precision, and beauty in one solution.

This technology enables jewelers to produce unique, personalized pieces more efficiently while tapping into emerging trends predicted by AI models. AI-powered design platforms support both beginners and experienced designers by simplifying complex processes like creating necklaces, bracelets, and earrings. These tools also assist in jewelry manufacturing and help businesses identify popular styles, enhancing decision-making for supply needs such as chains, clasps, and beads. The integration of AI in jewelry making is not just about design—it’s becoming a strategic asset for those looking to innovate and succeed. By leveraging AI jewelry design tools, creators can experiment with custom options faster and with greater precision. This means AI is playing a crucial role in jewelry personalization, improving concept development, and expanding opportunities for new business ideas in the industry. AI Jewelry Design Fundamentals AI technology has introduced new methods for creating intricate and personalized jewelry designs. It streamlines the design process, enhances creativity, and allows for the precise customization of various jewelry elements. How AI Transforms Jewelry Creation AI automates complex design tasks, enabling quicker generation of multiple jewelry concepts. It uses algorithms to produce detailed variations of chains, charms, beads, and clasps based on text prompts or initial sketches. This automation reduces the time between concept and prototype, helping designers explore a wider range of styles. AI also allows adjustment of materials, shapes, and patterns in real time, which improves efficiency in both crafting and manufacturing jewelry pieces. Key Concepts in AI Jewelry Design AI jewelry design operates on machine learning models trained to understand styles, materials, and construction techniques. These models generate designs that maintain structural integrity while reflecting current fashion trends. Designers input parameters like metal type, gem placement, and style preferences. The AI then produces realistic 3D visualizations or artistic renderings which can be refined further. This encourages experimentation with bead patterns, chain styles, and charm layouts that might be difficult with traditional methods. Role of AI in Custom Jewelry AI enhances custom jewelry creation by transforming client descriptions into precise designs. It simplifies personalization by dynamically adjusting size, shape, and material based on individual preferences. This technology supports the creation of engagement rings, bracelets, and earrings tailored to unique tastes. It enables rapid prototyping, which shortens turnaround times for one-of-a-kind pieces. By integrating customization tools, AI empowers both professional jewelers and hobbyists to deliver personalized, high-quality jewelry efficiently. AI Jewelry Generators and Tools AI jewelry design relies on specialized software that transforms user input into custom jewelry concepts. These tools vary in features but generally enable rapid design creation, customization, and export for manufacturing or marketing purposes. Overview of AI Jewelry Generators AI jewelry generators are digital platforms that use machine learning algorithms to create jewelry designs based on user input. They convert ideas, usually provided through text or sketches, into detailed, high-fidelity images or 3D models. This allows designers and hobbyists to visualize unique pieces without manual drafting. These generators support several jewelry types, including necklaces, rings, bracelets, and earrings. Some tools also generate specific elements like chain links, charms, and beads tailored for custom pieces. AI's role streamlines creative workflows while maintaining design precision. Popular AI Jewelry Design Platforms Several AI jewelry design platforms serve different user needs, from novices to professionals. Notable examples include Fluxai.art, Fotor’s AI Jewelry Generator, and Dzine’s AI Jewelry Design tool. Fluxai.art offers virtual try-on filters to visualize designs on a model, aiding e-commerce. Fotor is known for its ability to produce a broad range of design styles such as 3D, ink art, and watercolor from simple text prompts. Dzine emphasizes ease of use and quick concept generation, appealing to both designers and hobbyists. Many platforms require no login, allowing instant access. How Text Prompts Work in Jewelry Design Text prompts are concise descriptions inputted by the user to guide the AI in generating designs.

    "extractedText": "For retailers, brands, and ecommerce businesses, last-mile delivery is often the most expensive and unpredictable part of the shipping process. Customers expect fast, reliable deliveries, and a poor last-mile experience can lead to frustration, bad reviews, and lost sales. The challenge? Choosing the right carrier and service for each package while balancing speed, cost, and reliability. Traditionally, businesses rely on static shipping rules, past experiences, or guesswork to make these decisions—but AI is changing that. AI-powered last-mile logistics solutions help businesses analyze carrier performance, automate shipping decisions, and improve delivery outcomes—all without the need to manage their own delivery fleets. “Start small with clear objectives and scale gradually.” – Kushal Pillay This blog is part of a series that dives into four major ways AI can transform your shipping strategy: Improving time-in-transit predictions (Read it here) Transforming the customer experience (Read it here) Eliminating inefficiencies in the warehouse (Read it here) Optimizing last-mile delivery Smarter carrier selection based on performance data Not all carriers perform equally across all regions, shipment types, or service levels. AI analyzes millions of past deliveries to identify: Which carriers consistently meet on-time delivery promises Which services perform best in specific locations or under certain conditions How carrier performance shifts based on seasonality, weather, and demand surges Instead of relying on trial and error, retailers can use AI-powered insights to select the best-performing carriers for each shipment. AI-driven shipping method optimization Many businesses overpay for shipping because they default to faster, more expensive options, assuming that’s what’s needed. AI removes the guesswork by automating shipping decisions based on: Cost vs. speed trade-offs (e.g., when ground shipping is just as fast as express) Delivery success rates (ensuring the chosen service is reliable in that region) Real-time carrier pricing and service availability For example, AI might analyze past shipments and recommend switching 40% of next-day air shipments to ground, saving thousands of dollars without affecting delivery times. Predictive delivery performance and customer experience Customers hate vague or inaccurate delivery windows. AI solves this by analyzing real-time shipping conditions and historical data to: Provide more accurate delivery estimates at checkout Proactively detect and alert customers about potential delays Optimize carrier selections based on on-time delivery trends in each region This not only reduces missed deliveries and customer complaints but also improves trust and satisfaction. Cost reduction and operational efficiency By continuously analyzing carrier pricing, delivery speed, and reliability, AI can help businesses: Reduce shipping costs by automatically choosing lower-cost options that still meet customer expectations Improve delivery success rates, reducing returns, re-ships, and lost packages Optimize multi-carrier shipping strategies to prevent bottlenecks and capacity issues For high-volume shippers, these optimizations can lead to massive cost savings and more predictable logistics operations. AI is reshaping last-mile delivery—not by optimizing fleet operations, but by helping businesses make smarter carrier and service choices. Instead of guessing which shipping method is best, AI analyzes real data, automates decisions, and continuously improves outcomes. Now is the time to invest in AI AI is no longer a luxury in logistics—it’s a necessity. From predicting delivery times with greater accuracy to enhancing customer service, optimizing warehouse operations, and improving last-mile efficiency, AI is transforming every stage of the supply chain. Companies that embrace AI-driven solutions gain a competitive edge, reduce costs, and improve overall efficiency, while those that hesitate risk falling behind. The logistics industry is evolving faster than ever, and AI is at the center of this transformation. By leveraging AI-powered tools, businesses can eliminate inefficiencies, enhance decision-making, and future-proof their operations. The question is no longer if AI will impact logistics—it’s how fast companies can adopt it to stay ahead.

    "extractedText": "The OneRail Industry Insights Blog Tech-Forward, People-First: The Future of AI in Last Mile Delivery Written by Bill Catania Posted on September 11, 2025September 11, 2025 Artificial intelligence is transforming everything from how packages are routed to how customers interact with support. In this era of innovation and transition, there’s no doubt that companies should be embracing technology. But the real question is: How do you effectively integrate AI in the last mile without losing the human element? Consumers today expect speed, precision and frictionless on-demand service. But they also want empathy, understanding and someone who can step in when something goes wrong. Case in point: While AI can optimize a delivery route in milliseconds, it can’t yet offer reassurance to a frustrated customer whose package didn’t arrive on time. The companies that are winning in this new landscape are the ones that understand this balance — those that lead with innovation but never lose sight of the human touch. Forward-thinking brands are on a mission to prove that tech-forward doesn’t mean people-last. In fact, it’s the blend of both that defines the future of last mile delivery. The Innovation Imperative: Why We Automate The delivery landscape has never been more competitive. Shippers are navigating a blend of challenges, including tight margins, labor constraints and rising customer expectations for speed, convenience and transparency. In this high-pressure environment, operational efficiency is the survival strategy. That’s why AI and automation have become essential tools for gaining an edge. These technologies have emerged as solutions for unlocking new levels of reliability, scalability and customer satisfaction across the entire delivery journey. AI and automation are helping wholesale distributors and retailers make smart and fast decisions in a variety of ways: Route Optimization: Finding the fastest, most cost-effective paths in real time. Mode Selection: Automatically choosing the best delivery method based on cost, dimensions, weight, speed and SLA requirements. Predictive Analytics: Anticipating delays, demand surges and customer needs before they happen. Proactive Communications: Automating updates and alerts to customers and internal teams. Inventory Management: Enabling real-time visibility and smarter fulfillment decisions. Exception Detection: Identifying and flagging issues before they become customer-facing problems. And the industry is moving quickly to embrace these tools. The AI-enabled last mile delivery solutions market is experiencing rapid growth, and many in the industry see AI and automation as key solutions for building efficiency amid complexity and maintaining margins in a world where the last mile accounts for 52% of fulfillment costs. In short, AI and automation are now the foundation for building a delivery network that can compete in today’s market. But Tech Alone Isn’t Enough While AI and automation have unlocked incredible speed and scale, they’re not without blind spots. In the race to digitize every interaction, many companies have unintentionally created a new kind of friction — one where the human touch is increasingly hard to find. We’ve all experienced it: a delayed delivery, an incorrect order or a last-minute change and no clear way to get help. Instead of speaking to a real person, customers are funneled into automated phone trees, chatbots or endless email loops. In many scenarios like this, frustration builds, trust erodes and brand loyalty takes a hit. In these moments when something falls outside the algorithm, automation alone falls short. These situations demand nuance, judgment and empathy. And yet, in many tech-driven systems, there’s no clear path for a human to step in and make it right. It’s a growing pain across the industry. As technology advances, so does the risk of alienating the very customers it’s meant to serve. Because when something goes wrong, people don’t want a script — they want a solution, and often, they want it from another human being. Tractor Supply: High Tech Meets Human Expertise Ally Smith, VP of Customer Growth & Experience at OneRail, recently wrote about her team’s experience at Tractor Supply’s 2025 Partnership Conference. During the event, she made a powerful observation: Tractor Supply is building a future-ready retail model that still feels personal and local. And that’s no easy feat. In a time when many retailers are chasing automation for its own sake, Tractor Supply stands out by using technology to enhance rather than replace the customer experience. Same-day pickups, localized fulfillment and intelligent delivery are all in play, but these innovations are grounded in one core truth: Tractor Supply’s customers still want real connections. Sometimes that means walking into a store to ask a question. Other times, it means expecting a delivery that arrives not just on time, but with care. What Tractor Supply understands is that",

It’s the stretch between the distribution center and the customer’s doorstep, and it’s often the most complex, costly, and unpredictable part of the journey. Today, artificial intelligence (AI) is rewriting the rules for last-mile delivery, driving breakthroughs in route optimization, drone delivery, and theft prevention that are transforming how packages are delivered and how customers experience the delivery process.Route Optimization: Smarter Paths, Faster DeliveriesTraditional route planning relied on static maps and manual scheduling. However, with AI, delivery networks now leverage real-time data, such as traffic patterns, weather, customer preferences, and even local events, to dynamically optimize routes. Machine learning algorithms analyze thousands of variables, recalculating the most efficient paths in real-time. This results in reduced fuel costs, shorter delivery windows, and happier customers.AI-powered route optimization isn’t just about speed. It’s about resilience. During peak seasons, when volumes surge and bottlenecks threaten performance, intelligent routing ensures every parcel finds its way efficiently. This agility is crucial for supply chain leaders who must adapt quickly and maintain service levels under pressure.

    "extractedText": "January 2023 Last-Mile Delivery Innovation: Current and Upcoming Trends Safety Workforce Management This article will explore the newest trends and developments in last-mile delivery, examining the current state of the market, its evolving nature, and predictions for its future. Businesses must keep up with major players like Amazon, Uber, and Walmart, which rely on cutting-edge technology to make last-mile delivery faster, more traceable, and efficient. With customer expectations increasing, more businesses implement technology to expedite shipping requests, and several notable trends in the last-mile delivery market are emerging. Last-Mile Delivery Explained Last-mile delivery is a term that typically refers to the final leg of a package's journey to a residential address. It can also include businesses and other destinations. Last-mile delivery is commonly considered the most challenging and costly part of the delivery process because it involves navigating complex residential areas to deliver packages to individual homes and buildings. An ever-evolving field, last-mile delivery is influenced by various trends and statistics, including technological advancements, consumer demands, and logistics challenges. In the current market, many businesses are discovering advanced technologies that improve their mobile operations’ efficiency, irrespective of the size of their fleet or number of drivers, reducing costs and improving customer service. Current and Future Trends in Last-Mile Delivery Innovation The e-commerce industry is largely driving the growth of the last-mile delivery industry. With the increasing popularity of online shopping, the demand for last-mile delivery services is expected to grow. According to recent statistics, the global Last-Mile Delivery for the E-commerce market was worth USD $38.5 million in 2021 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12.1% over the forecast period, reaching USD $76.5 million by 2027. Consumers today have higher expectations and want same-day or next-day delivery options and complete transparency throughout the shipping process. Meeting these demands and providing a positive customer experience is critical for cultivating brand loyalty and remaining competitive in the current and future marketplace. Last-mile delivery innovation and technology are making it possible to meet market demands and more. Businesses increasingly leverage smart technology, drones, delivery robots, and electric vehicles to help streamline operations, reduce costs, and improve delivery times. While trends vary depending on location, industry, and the specific needs of each delivery, we will look at these innovative technologies in greater detail below. Smart Tech and Real-Time Tracking Customers want more certainty, convenience, and visibility in their delivery options. Therefore, companies must find new ways to meet the expectations of consumers and businesses, who want precise delivery times and the assurance that their purchases will arrive on time. Real-time tracking using smart technology plays a major role in supporting a faster and more transparent last-mile delivery process to connect the planned delivery time to the current whereabouts. With the use of IoT-enabled sensors and GPS-enabled devices, every shipment movement can be tracked. Further, artificial intelligence and machine learning technology, like Tourmo AI, is being deployed to analyze data to predict demand and anticipate potential problems while automating many operational processes required to streamline the entire delivery process. Companies that do not use smart tech should evaluate their current technology solutions and consider incorporating this technology to optimize their last-mile delivery operations by making them highly transparent and reliable. Hybrid Fleet Management Systems and Insourcing Many businesses are incorporating the latest last-mile delivery trend, “hybrid fleet management.” It combines a trucking company's vehicles with outside contractors, third-party providers, and freelance drivers to adjust the fleet size to match fluctuations in demand and keep capital costs down. Conversely, many companies manage the last-mile delivery internally, using their own fleet vehicles or a combination of company-owned and contracted vehicles, rather than outsourcing the delivery. Businesses that go for this option, a.k.a. insourcing, can gain better control over their delivery operations while avoiding some of the downsides of conventional outsourcing. Despite this, outsourcing remains the preferred choice, with many companies collaborating with third parties to decrease last-mile delivery expenses. The hybrid fleet management trend has led some third-party logistics providers to create their own local delivery service to rival insourcing, complete with vehicles and personnel for local deliveries.

This evolution is reshaping the skills, strategies, and mindsets that luxury professionals need. The MA International Luxury Business (Online) program at Vogue College of Fashion is designed for future leaders who want to understand, drive and lead this change in a connected world. Rethinking Luxury for the Digital Age According to Elaine Parr, consumer leader of EMEA, IBM, in Evolve or Fade Away: Enriching Luxury Heritage in the AI Era (Vogue Business x IBM, January 2025), “The luxury industry, a business built on timeless heritage and unparalleled craftsmanship, stands at a pivotal juncture. Once unassailable, we see a softening market, with 2025 set to be among the most challenging on record. At the same time, there is a delicate balance between enriching legacy and being future facing; moving at the pace of today’s tech to stay relevant.” Consumers now expect luxury to meet them where they are: on their devices, in virtual worlds, and across seamless on- and offline experiences. Whether it’s the rise of AI-generated collections, gamified campaigns, or personalised clienteling through data insights, luxury brands are using innovation to cultivate deeper emotional connections with their audiences. AI and Virtual Craftsmanship Artificial Intelligence is now influencing everything from trend forecasting to digital design. Some brands are even using AI to reinterpret archival designs or tailor customer experiences in real time. This shift is not about replacing human creativity but enhancing it with new tools and possibilities. Virtual design software and generative AI tools are empowering designers to prototype and iterate faster while reducing waste and improving sustainability — key concerns for the future of the industry. By reducing textile waste, shortening production timelines and enabling on-demand customisation, this technology is transforming what craftsmanship means in the 21st century—without compromising creativity or care. Immersive Brand Worlds From virtual catwalks to interactive flagship store experiences, luxury brands are redefining the runway and the retail floor through digital storytelling. These are carefully crafted ecosystems that fuse art, technology and narrative to create unforgettable moments of connection. Whether it’s Gucci’s Roblox sneakers, Louis Vuitton’s metaverse collaborations, or Chanel’s multisensory installations, the goal is clear: to create experiences where consumers don’t just observe luxury—they inhabit it. These touchpoints offer new spaces for emotion, engagement and loyalty, especially as the next generation of luxury consumers seeks meaning, not just status. At Vogue College of Fashion, students are actively engaging with this future. In the AI Meets High Fashion workshop, students explored how creative AI tools are reshaping fashion storytelling, from digital garments to generative design processes. To explore these frontiers further, Vogue College of Fashion launched the Fashion Media Futures Symposium, a one-day event that brought together thought leaders across media, AI, tech and fashion. From live panel discussions to student-led creative showcases, the symposium spotlighted how emerging platforms and technologies are reshaping the future of fashion communication. Future-Proof Your Luxury Career As the luxury industry evolves, so must the people shaping it. The MA International Luxury Business (Online) at Vogue College of Fashion equips students to confidently navigate this changing landscape. Johannes Reponen, Global Academic Director at Vogue College of Fashion, shares: “The online MA in International Luxury Business represents the future of fashion and luxury careers. This flexible, comprehensive program is designed to meet the needs of modern professionals and equips them with the skills necessary to lead in an increasingly digital and global luxury market.” Delivered online for maximum flexibility, the program helps students: Develop a strategic understanding of global luxury trends Explore how technology is redefining customer experience and value Build leadership skills in an increasingly digital-first industry Whether you’re pivoting careers or enhancing your expertise, this future-focused master’s helps you stay ahead of the curve in a competitive global industry.

The air is thick with anticipation as models glide through a labyrinth of high-speed processors and tangled cables, moving like avatars in a hyper-modern landscape. True to form, Coperni’s AW25 Paris Fashion Week show is no ordinary catwalk; it’s a complex commentary on our relationship with technology. Gaming enthusiasts and digital futurists sit shoulder-to-shoulder, immersed in a world where fashion meets the tech frontier. At the center of it all? The Ray-Ban Meta x Coperni limited-edition Wayfarers–AI-powered smart glasses that allow the wearer to capture photos hands-free, translate speech in real-time, and seamlessly integrate the digital with the physical. It’s a bold vision of what’s to come: fashion that doesn’t just dress the body, but enhances the way we interact with the world around us.Coperni has built its reputation on moments like this. From that viral spray-on dress – applied directly onto Bella Hadid’s body on the runway to its Air Swipe bag made from NASA-developed silica aerogel, the brand is relentlessly pushing the boundaries of what fashion can be. And Coperni isn’t alone. Houses like Gucci, Valentino, and Moncler are racing toward the future too, using AI-generated campaign imagery, creating NFTs to sell in Web3, and launching personal shopping tools that leverage ChatGPT. These activations have been eye-opening and provocative, offering glimpses of a high-tech fashion future, but they’ve sometimes run the risk of feeling gimmicky—more spectacle than substance.River Callaway//Getty ImagesThe Coperni autumn/winter 2025 showBy contrast, many of fashion’s most storied houses, particularly those under the LVMH umbrella, have taken a more measured approach. Rather than chasing social media’s ephemeral ‘viral moment,’ they’ve integrated AI and digital tools in ‘quiet’ ways that feel almost invisible to the average consumer. “Luxury is about appreciation of product quality and craftsmanship,” says Gonzague De Pirey, the chief omnichannel and data officer at LVMH. “Tech and innovation are not a goal in themselves; they are in service of our mission.” This philosophy prioritizes refinement over drama, ensuring that technology works behind the scenes to enhance, rather than distract from, the luxury shopping experience.So, what does this mean for the future of luxury shopping? How does AI elevate, rather than cheapen, the most exclusive retail experiences in the world? If the latest developments are anything to go by, the answer lies in ‘quiet tech’—subtle but game-changing innovations that work behind the seams to make everything feel smoother, more personal, and effortlessly luxurious.1. Online shopping will be curated by a stylist …just not a human one. Luxury eCommerce is in the middle of an AI-powered glow-up. If you’ve ever browsed sites like Net-a-Porter, Moda Operandi, or Farfetch, you’ve probably noticed the slow shift towards hyper-personalized shopping. But in the next five years, AI will take things up several notches.Expect virtual try-ons that actually work (goodbye, awkward AR filters), AI-driven styling services that learn your taste over time, and predictive inventory that ensures the pieces you love are never unavailable in your size. Net-a-Porter, for example, has been experimenting with AI-powered personal shoppers that can refine recommendations based on past purchases and browsing behavior. Moda Operandi is using machine learning to predict emerging trends before they explode, helping buyers snap up exclusive pieces before they become impossible to find.And let’s not forget about Farfetch, which is leading the charge in AI-driven logistics — meaning faster deliveries, smarter stock distribution, and a more seamless checkout experience. The goal? A shopping journey that feels almost psychic in its ability to understand what you want before you even know it yourself.2. Your in-store assistant will feel like your best friendLuxury shopping has always been about VIP treatment. The held-open doors, a whiff of rich leather, a glass of champagne while you browse and somebody helpfully carrying your pieces to the changing room for you. As counterintuitive as it might sound, the teams at many leading luxury brands are focused on getting more people offline and back into the practice of shopping in brick-and-mortar stores, by making it an enriching and unforgettable experience. At LVMH, AI-powered clienteling apps help sales associates anticipate a VIP’s preferences before they even step foot in ",

The author adopts a mixed-method research approach that integrates a quantitative survey and structural equation modeling analysis with qualitative Natural Language Processing (NLP). The findings reveal that generative AI promotional content impacts millennials and Gen Z’s purchase intention due to its perceived entertainment, transparency, and usefulness. Status motivations had a stronger impact on purchase intention, and demographic characteristics were significantly different in their results. The study is the first to examine the human characteristics of perceived expertise, transparency, and entertainment in an AI context in light of status consumption motivation. As AI is expected to have more human-like characteristics and behavior, testing theories centered on human influence in an AI context is crucial for marketing theory and practice.

A review of use cases and how to mitigate risk. By Rebecca Sentance April 3rd 2024 15:59 Content [caption id=\"attachment_552275\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1000\"] Image: Shutterstock[/caption] Thinking of luxury goods typically brings to mind tradition, heritage and a time-honoured approach rather than fast-paced modernity. But luxury brands have also been keen to position themselves as technological innovators – embracing trends like blockchain, the metaverse, and NFTs. “The luxury sector has always been at the forefront of innovation,” Kate Anthony, Managing Director at global media agency Spark Foundry, told Econsultancy. “Embracing new approaches and new ideas is in its very fibre, [and] utilising the latest in technology is no different.” Therefore, it comes as little surprise that the luxury sector has welcomed the advent of generative AI, with brands like Valentino and Prada using generative AI imagery in marketing campaigns, and the likes of Collina Strada and G-Star Raw using generative AI as part of the product design process. Other applications for generative AI include customer support, virtual shopping agents, and data analysis for personalisation. But where does generative AI fit in with luxury brands’ reputation for authenticity and a direct, human relationship with customers? With backlash being levied at brands such as fashion brand Selkie or Levi’s that are perceived to be using generative AI to cut costs and corners, do luxury brands risk alienating their customer base over their use of the technology?

    "extractedText": "AI is not gonna save your 🍑 in luxury marketing. It's the enabler, not the replacer. Report this article Thomas Wieringa Thomas Wieringa Published Mar 6, 2025 + Follow I hate writing about AI—there’s already an endless stream of articles and opinions on the topic. Yet, every day in my line of work, I witness brands grappling with the promise of AI, believing it can solve every problem. This overreliance on technology not only oversimplifies complex challenges but also dangerously underestimates the unparalleled power of human connection—the true holy grail of private client engagement. In the world of luxury, where every detail is meticulously crafted to evoke emotion and exclusivity, AI must be seen as an enabler, not a replacer. The magic of luxury is born from experiential marketing and one-on-one engagements that build lasting relationships. No algorithm, however advanced, can replicate the bespoke charm of a personal consultation or the unforgettable ambiance of a high-end event. Luxury brands have always thrived on exclusivity, personal service, and immersive experiences. In recent years, artificial intelligence has quietly become a game-changer for the luxury industry – but not by automating it away. Instead, AI is emerging as the ultimate concierge behind the scenes, enhancing bespoke experiences without replacing the human touch. From high-end retail boutiques and five-star hotels to luxury auto showrooms and private banks, the message is clear: AI’s role is to support and elevate the luxury experience, while the magic of human connection and physical brand engagement remains paramount. The High-Tech, High-Touch Paradox in Luxury Recent research from top consultancies and industry reports reveals that while AI holds immense promise for boosting operational efficiencies and personalizing the customer journey, luxury brands are treading carefully. For instance, a 2024 Bain & Company study noted that while many luxury maisons have only implemented a few AI-driven solutions, nearly every brand is actively exploring additional applications to enhance customer engagement and streamline internal processes. Similarly, McKinsey’s latest findings suggest that generative AI alone could add up to $275 billion in operating profits to the fashion and luxury sectors over the next few years. Yet caution tempers this excitement. Both analysts and luxury executives recognize that AI must not dilute luxury’s essence of authenticity, creativity, and emotional resonance. Bain’s study notes that brands are wary of deploying AI in core creative functions for fear of “altering luxury’s essence or compromising its authenticity”. This mirrors findings from the the State of Fashion 2024 survey, where 73% of fashion executives named generative AI a top priority, but only 28% had experimented with AI in design and product development – highlighting a prudent wait-and-see approach in creative areas. Yet, the real insight here is not in the raw numbers but in the strategy behind them. Luxury brands understand that while AI can analyze data, predict trends, and optimize logistics, it cannot replace the sensory, emotional, and experiential aspects of luxury. AI-powered chatbots might provide immediate responses, but they can’t replicate the warmth of a face-to-face conversation or the personal touch of a dedicated client advisor. AI: The Enabler, Not the Replacer Across the luxury spectrum—from high-end fashion and fine spirits to automotive excellence and private banking—the message is consistent: AI is an enabler, not a replacer. Technology can process vast amounts of data, forecast trends, and optimize operations with unprecedented speed and accuracy. But at the end of the day, luxury is about creating an emotional, sensory experience that leaves a lasting imprint on the client’s heart. When a client walks into a boutique, attends a private event, or receives a personal consultation, what they experience is far more than just efficiency. They experience care, passion, and an unwavering commitment to excellence. AI’s role is to provide the insights and efficiencies that empower human experts to deliver these moments of connection. As I often remind my clients, “No matter how sophisticated your digital tools become, the physical 1:1 engagements in a private client program between client and brand cannot be replaced by AI.” Experiential Marketing: The Unrivaled Heart of Luxury Built on a foundation of emotions, storytelling, and sensory indulgence, luxury is an arena where no algorithm can capture the full magic. Even as AI scales personalized marketing, top-tier luxury brands are ramping up their investment in experiential marketing—80% of companies are increasing their budgets, allocating as much as 30% to immersive, real-world engagements. These brands are crafting elaborate events and bespoke moments that go far beyond digital interactions to forge lasting memories. Why this unwavering focus on experiences? Today’s affluent m",

Traditional growth models show signs of fatigue, while institutional pressures push brands toward more authentic commitments to sustainability, ethics, and inclusion (Larranaga & Valor, 2022; Teona et al., 2020). Simultaneously, luxury brands face a rapidly shifting competitive landscape, with changes in global markets, consumer expectations, and technological innovation. In this context, advertising is central to redefining the identity, desirability, and legitimacy of luxury brands. As Ko (2020) noted in a previous International Journal of Advertising special issue, the study of luxury advertising requires continuous theoretical and methodological renewal. Building on that foundation, this special issue seeks to advance conceptual, empirical, and interdisciplinary insights into how luxury advertising is being reimagined through artificial intelligence (AI), emerging technologies, influencer ecosystems, and sustainability. We especially invite contributions that explore the tensions between tradition and innovation, authenticity and automation, exclusivity and accessibility, and symbolism and data-driven personalization. Artificial Intelligence and New Technologies Artificial intelligence (AI) and related technologies are reshaping luxury advertising by enabling hyper-personalization, predictive analytics, and novel creative outputs (Qi et al., 2025). From generative content to immersive AR and metaverse campaigns, these tools extend luxury’s narrative potential and promise new consumer experiences. Yet research highlights ambivalence in consumer responses: AI-generated advertising can appear inauthentic and misaligned with luxury’s aura of craftsmanship and artistry (To et al., 2025; Xu & Mehta, 2022). Success often depends on trust and perceived humanness, with consumers more receptive when AI is positioned as augmenting rather than replacing human creativity (Jung et al., 2025; Ryoo et al., 2025). This suggests that the integration of AI into luxury advertising not only offers opportunities but also introduces tensions that demand deeper theoretical exploration. We invite research that advances theoretical and empirical understanding of how luxury brands can adopt AI without eroding symbolic value or authenticity. Relevant questions include how AI-generated avatars and chatbots alter perceptions of brand aesthetics, how predictive modeling balances personalization with transparency and privacy concerns, and under what conditions immersive technologies (NFTs, AR filters, metaverse campaigns) enhance rather than commodify the luxury experience (Cho, Ko, & Jung 2024; Cho, Ko, & Taylor, 2024; SanMiguel, Sádaba, & Sayeed, 2024; Wang, Ko, & Milfeld, 2025). Current evidence remains fragmented, highlighting opportunities for deeper investigation of cultural, ethical, and aesthetic implications. Influencers and Evolving Communication Ecosystem Ecosystem Influencers—whether human, virtual, or AI-generated—have become central to luxury advertising, shaping consumer aspirations and brand legitimacy across digital platforms. Their effectiveness, however, is contingent on credibility, authenticity, exclusivity, and cultural context, raising persistent tensions in luxury communication (Huang & Zhou, 2025; Pedroni, 2023). While collaborations with influencers can amplify reach and relatability, over-commercialization risks diminishing attention, trust, and distinctiveness (Chaihanchanchai, 2025; Lu et al., 2025; Xie et al., 2025). At the same time, AI-powered tools increasingly influence this ecosystem—identifying influencers, generating personalized recommendations, and even producing content (Aldous et al., 2024; Ramachandran et al., 2024). These innovations complicate the balance between technological precision and the symbolic codes of luxury, highlighting an urgent need for systematic inquiry. We welcome studies that clarify how different types of influencers—celebrity, micro, or virtual—shape luxury consumers’ perceptions, and how effects vary across platforms, cu",

    "extractedText": "Nov 03, 2025 Tony Crisafi How AI for Retail Jewelry Brands Is Increasing Sales in 2025 Share this article Discover How Artificial Intelligence Is Reshaping Jewelry Retail Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing how retail jewelry brands connect with shoppers, streamline operations, and grow revenue. From personalized recommendations to smart inventory forecasting, AI gives jewelry retailers a competitive edge—especially those working in fast-moving categories like stainless steel, fashion, and trend-driven pieces. Whether you operate a brick-and-mortar store or sell online, leveraging AI tools can dramatically increase your sales in 2025 and beyond. Let’s explore the most powerful AI strategies for retail jewelry brands and how to implement them. AI-Powered Virtual Try-On & Visual Tools Augmented reality and AI are changing the way customers shop for jewelry—especially online. By offering virtual try-on features, brands can build shopper confidence, increase engagement, and reduce returns. How Virtual Try-On Increases Jewelry Sales AI and AR-powered tools allow shoppers to \"try on\" rings, earrings, necklaces, and bracelets using just their smartphone or laptop camera. These tools use computer vision to detect facial features and hand shapes, rendering realistic previews of how pieces will look when worn. Not only do virtual try-ons reduce return rates, they also enhance conversion by making the experience more interactive. This is especially effective for trend-driven pieces like oversized hoops or statement necklaces—where visual appeal drives the purchase decision. Enhancing Product Visualization with AI Beyond virtual try-on, AI can generate 3D product visualizations that allow customers to rotate and zoom in on jewelry pieces. These features are crucial for fashion jewelry and stainless steel accessories where texture, shine, and styling are key selling points. Chatbots & AI-Powered Customer Support Exceptional customer service is a major driver of retail sales—and AI can help you deliver it at scale. Smart chatbots and AI-driven help desks can answer customer questions in real time, no matter the hour. 24/7 AI Chatbots for Retail Jewelry Stores AI chatbots are now sophisticated enough to handle inquiries about product details, shipping, sizing, and even style recommendations. This technology is especially useful for online wholesale jewelry brands where high product volume and frequent customer inquiries can strain human support teams. AI bots can help customers choose the right chain length, identify matching earrings, or resolve pre-sale concerns instantly—leading to more conversions with less friction. Sentiment Analysis & Post-Purchase Support AI can also analyze reviews, returns, and chat transcripts to detect patterns and common customer issues. Sentiment analysis allows brands to proactively fix problems, respond to negative experiences, and improve satisfaction—all of which help drive long-term sales. Predictive Analytics & Inventory Optimization Retail jewelry brands—especially wholesalers—need to manage stock levels carefully. AI predictive analytics help forecast demand, reduce overstock, and ensure top-selling items are always available. Forecasting Trends Before They Happen AI tools analyze customer behavior, historical sales, seasonal shifts, and even fashion trend data to anticipate future demand. For example, if AI detects growing interest in layered stainless steel necklaces or zodiac-themed charm bracelets, your team can increase orders and marketing efforts in advance. This demand forecasting reduces inventory waste and helps you stay ahead of seasonal trends—critical for success in fast-moving categories like fashion jewelry. Smarter Merchandising with AI Insights Clienteling tools powered by AI help retailers connect with past buyers by recommending products they're likely to purchase next. These tools allow in-store associates and e-commerce platforms to suggest products based on purchase history, preferences, and browsing behavior—leading to more personalized upsells and stronger customer loyalty. Personalized Marketing & Recommendation Engines Consumers expect personalization—and AI makes it scalable. From product recommendations to targeted email campaigns, AI lets you market the right product to the right customer at the right time. AI Product Recommendations That Drive Sales Recommendation engines analyze customer data—such as product views, abandoned carts, and wishlist activity—to suggest jewelry pieces that align with each shopper’s tastes. These tools can dynamically update homepage displays, shopping carts, or follow-up emails to boost conversion rates. A shopper who browses stainless steel rings in gold tones might be shown coordinating earrings or layered bracelets that complete the look. These relevant suggestions increase average order value and reduce bounce rates. AI Marketing in Action: A Real Retail Example Brands like Kendra Scott use AI “copilot” tools ",

    "extractedText": "AI Jewelry Design Trends 2025: Innovative Tools and Customization Techniques Artificial Intelligence is changing the way jewelry is designed and made, offering powerful tools that streamline creativity and customization. AI jewelry generators can create detailed chain designs, charm patterns, and even bead arrangements quickly, allowing designers to explore fresh ideas with ease. This technology enables jewelers to produce unique, personalized pieces more efficiently while tapping into emerging trends predicted by AI models. AI-powered design platforms support both beginners and experienced designers by simplifying complex processes like creating necklaces, bracelets, and earrings. These tools also assist in jewelry manufacturing and help businesses identify popular styles, enhancing decision-making for supply needs such as chains, clasps, and beads. The integration of AI in jewelry making is not just about design—it’s becoming a strategic asset for those looking to innovate and succeed. By leveraging AI jewelry design tools, creators can experiment with custom options faster and with greater precision. This means AI is playing a crucial role in jewelry personalization, improving concept development, and expanding opportunities for new business ideas in the industry. AI Jewelry Design Fundamentals AI technology has introduced new methods for creating intricate and personalized jewelry designs. It streamlines the design process, enhances creativity, and allows for the precise customization of various jewelry elements. How AI Transforms Jewelry Creation AI automates complex design tasks, enabling quicker generation of multiple jewelry concepts. It uses algorithms to produce detailed variations of chains, charms, beads, and clasps based on text prompts or initial sketches. This automation reduces the time between concept and prototype, helping designers explore a wider range of styles. AI also allows adjustment of materials, shapes, and patterns in real time, which improves efficiency in both crafting and manufacturing jewelry pieces. Key Concepts in AI Jewelry Design AI jewelry design operates on machine learning models trained to understand styles, materials, and construction techniques. These models generate designs that maintain structural integrity while reflecting current fashion trends. Designers input parameters like metal type, gem placement, and style preferences. The AI then produces realistic 3D visualizations or artistic renderings which can be refined further. This encourages experimentation with bead patterns, chain styles, and charm layouts that might be difficult with traditional methods. Role of AI in Custom Jewelry AI enhances custom jewelry creation by transforming client descriptions into precise designs. It simplifies personalization by dynamically adjusting size, shape, and material based on individual preferences. This technology supports the creation of engagement rings, bracelets, and earrings tailored to unique tastes. It enables rapid prototyping, which shortens turnaround times for one-of-a-kind pieces. By integrating customization tools, AI empowers both professional jewelers and hobbyists to deliver personalized, high-quality jewelry efficiently. AI Jewelry Generators and Tools AI jewelry design relies on specialized software that transforms user input into custom jewelry concepts. These tools vary in features but generally enable rapid design creation, customization, and export for manufacturing or marketing purposes. Overview of AI Jewelry Generators AI jewelry generators are digital platforms that use machine learning algorithms to create jewelry designs based on user input. They convert ideas, usually provided through text or sketches, into detailed, high-fidelity images or 3D models. This allows designers and hobbyists to visualize unique pieces without manual drafting. These generators support several jewelry types, including necklaces, rings, bracelets, and earrings. Some tools also generate specific elements like chain links, charms, and beads tailored for custom pieces. AI's role streamlines creative workflows while maintaining design precision. Popular AI Jewelry Design Platforms Several AI jewelry design platforms serve different user needs, from novices to professionals. Notable examples include Fluxai.art, Fotor’s AI Jewelry Generator, and Dzine’s AI Jewelry Design tool. Fluxai.art offers virtual try-on filters to visualize designs on a model, aiding e-commerce. Fotor is known for its ability to produce a broad range of design styles such as 3D, ink art, and watercolor from simple text prompts. Dzine emphasizes ease of use and quick concept generation, appealing to both designers and hobbyists. Many platforms require no login, allowing instant access.

    "extractedText": "Feature Gems & Gemology, Fall 2024, Vol. 60, No. 3 Generative Artificial Intelligence as a Tool for Jewelry Design Michael D. Magee Download PDF Figure 1. Midjourney 5.2 image variations produced from the prompt “a pair of 18 karat yellow gold earrings featuring a fusion of Art Deco and ancient Egyptian styles.” At each stage in this figure, the user selects one of the images (marked here by the colored square boundary) and feeds it back into the AI, which generates four new variations. In this manner, the image is further refined to suit the tastes of the designer or the client. ABSTRACT While the jewelry industry is deeply rooted in traditional tools and techniques, generative artificial intelligence (AI) must be recognized today as a revolutionary tool to assist jewelers. The intersection between AI and the creative arts is especially controversial, and the use of generative AI in jewelry design is no different. This paper examines how generative AI creates designs based on text and image prompts, comparing five of the more common AI programs (Midjourney, DALL.E, Stable Diffusion, Leonardo, and Firefly) with a focus on generating realistic jewelry images. It addresses the ethical, legal, and regulatory questions that have arisen around AI-generated art. Lastly, it explores how this new technology can best be used by jewelry designers to enhance creative expression. The allure of jewelry lies in its intricate design, the craftsmanship behind each piece, and the significance and lore we attach to particular jewels. From the skilled hands of ancient goldsmiths to the precision of modern-day artisans, the creation of jewelry has always been a deeply human endeavor. But as we stand on the brink of a new era, the time-honored traditions of jewelry design are converging with the cutting-edge advancements of artificial intelligence. This convergence has opened up a new frontier in design and creation, with generative AI making its way into the designer’s workshop alongside traditional tools and techniques. For decades, computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) and other digital design tools have been widely used by jewelry designers. However, generative AI reaches into a new realm where computers have become capable of generating unique designs with seemingly little to no direction or human input. In the context of jewelry design, this technology offers the potential to redefine the boundaries of creativity and production. Despite the exciting possibilities, this fusion of AI with the creative arts is not without controversy. Concerns range from the potential displacement of skilled artisans to the ethical implications of AI-generated art. As one U.S.-based digital advertising agency noted, “AI-generated content, while impressive in its ability to analyze trends and produce designs quickly, may lack the nuanced touch and emotional connection that is often conveyed through a human designer’s work. This could lead to a homogenization of design styles, as AI algorithms tend to optimize for efficiency and patterns in data rather than the bespoke artistry that clients seek” (JEMSU, n.d.). “AIDEATION” AND “HALLUCINATION” One of the most powerful opportunities that AI technology presents is the ability to brainstorm design ideas at incredible speed. Sometimes referred to by the play on words “AIdeation,” quickly creating ideas as starting points is becoming the most common use case for AI in design. With an input consisting of only a few words, AI can generate many iterations from a single concept or idea. As an example of a potential “AIdeation” workflow, consider the design of a pair of earrings for a client who is passionate about both ancient Egyptian and Art Deco styles. After a short description, or “prompt,” is entered into Midjourney (docs.midjourney.com/docs/prompts), the program quickly returns four original images blending these styles for the user to choose from (figure 1). These images are simply stepping stones to more variations. The user can choose any of the options to explore and create variations based on that image, making widely varied options at first and then refining the image through minor alterations. In approximately five minutes, Midjourney can generate 16 or more variations to begin designing around. Figure 2. Images from Midjourney 5.2 using the prompt “a pair of white gold earrings displaying a sense of asymmetrical balance.” Figure 3. Images generated by Midjourney 5.2 from the prompt “a rose gold pendant with contrasting round gems.” “Hallucination” is a common term used in reference to the popular ChatGPT or other text-based AI chatbot programs, where the program makes up patently false information in its answers. While this understandably poses a significant problem when attempting to collect and summarize factual information, it is actually a benefit where image generation is concerned. The images created by generative AI are not collages cut and pasted from different images ",

While jewelry has always balanced artistry and aspiration, AI is poised to reshape not only how brands sell but also how buyers discover, personalize, and experience luxury pieces. Below are the most significant ways AI will influence luxury jewelry sales in the years ahead: 1. Hyper-Personalized Shopping Experiences AI will allow luxury jewelers to move beyond broad market segmentation into true one-to-one personalization. By analyzing browsing behavior, purchase history, and even social media preferences, AI can curate collections tailored to each buyer. Instead of a generic online storefront, clients could be shown pieces that match their personal style, favorite gemstones, or even align with upcoming anniversaries and milestones. This level of personalization strengthens the emotional connection between buyer and brand—a critical factor in the luxury market, where purchases are deeply personal and often symbolic. 2. Virtual Try-On and Immersive Experiences Luxury shoppers often want to see and feel jewelry before making a purchase. AI-powered augmented reality (AR) will help replicate that in digital environments. From trying on a Cartier bracelet through a smartphone camera to virtually layering diamond necklaces during an online consultation, these tools remove hesitation from online buying. For high-value pieces, AI could combine AR with digital twin technology, letting clients preview how a bespoke design would look on their hand or neckline before commissioning it. This bridges the gap between online and in-store experiences. 3. Predictive Analytics for Inventory and Trends Luxury jewelry brands often face challenges with inventory: precious stones and metals are costly to stock, and demand for specific designs can fluctuate. AI can help by predicting which designs, cuts, or gemstones will trend next. By analyzing global search patterns, fashion shows, celebrity endorsements, and influencer activity, AI can forecast demand more accurately. For retailers, this means better inventory management and reduced waste. For consumers, it ensures exclusivity remains intact while still offering trend-aligned designs. 4. Enhanced Customer Relationship Management In the luxury space, loyalty is everything. AI-powered CRM systems will allow jewelers to anticipate client needs: suggesting a diamond pendant upgrade before a 10th wedding anniversary, reminding about annual cleaning, or flagging a limited-edition launch to a VIP client. Rather than replacing human sales associates, AI will supercharge concierge-style service, allowing jewelers to maintain a sense of intimacy at scale. Conclusion: AI as a Catalyst for Emotional Luxury At its core, luxury jewelry is not just a purchase—it’s an expression of love, identity, and legacy. AI won’t replace human artistry or the allure of a Tiffany diamond, but it will enhance how those stories are told, experienced, and delivered. For brands, embracing AI means unlocking new levels of personalization, efficiency, and authenticity. For buyers, it means a more seamless, immersive, and emotionally resonant journey. In short, the luxury jewelry industry’s most dazzling future gem may very well be powered by artificial intelligence.

Legislators and consumers alike are demanding transparency, sustainability, and accountability. The operational challenges are immense. The reality? Without advanced PLM modules, tailored automations, and integrated AI capabilities, managing this depth of data load would be next to impossible. Yet, while workloads have increased dramatically, team sizes remain largely unchanged. This is where technology becomes the enabler of both compliance and competitive advantage. Recommended by LinkedIn Houston: A Community in the Making Mush Khan 3 years ago Money for nothing and PLM for free Rob Ferrone 9 months ago Navigating Innovation in Intralogistics: A… Fives Intralogistics Corp. 1 year ago Key Takeaways Tracing Data: New demands extend far beyond what legacy processes can manage. From raw material origins to lifecycle tracking, the data journey is comprehensive and complex. AI’s Role: Automating data analysis, identifying patterns, and generating actionable insights bridge the gap between compliance and efficiency. PLM Evolution: Modern PLMs must integrate seamlessly with automation scripts and AI systems to offer a scalable, sustainable solution. From PLM to Consumer Value: The data that is gathered around a product is not only valuable for legislative purposes. It can form the starting point in understanding more about the product and its journey. Used well, this can in turn improve future collections, help decision-making and have a positive effect on margins. The revolution in AI and automation is not just about keeping up, it is now about making the impossible possible. As the brands and retailers that we work with adopt these tools, they are not only meeting demands for transparency, but also unlocking new opportunities to connect with consumers and gaining the ability to show where they create sustainable value. We again must reimagine what is possible in the fashion industry. This time, legislation and the resulting data flow is playing a bigger role than ever before.",

    "extractedText": "Posted on May 16, 2025 by qualdevTop AI Trends Reshaping e-Commerce in 2025 and Beyond The e-Commerce industry is undergoing a major transformation. Artificial Intelligence is no longer a side innovation; it’s at the heart of digital strategy. As we move deeper into 2025, brands are leveraging AI to boost customer experience, automate backend operations, and optimize decision-making with intelligent data. At QualDev, we’ve seen how AI-driven solutions are helping e-Commerce businesses future-proof their platforms, streamline workflows, and deliver unmatched personalization. Here are the top AI trends reshaping digital commerce in 2025 along with real industry use cases (without third-party endorsements) to bring each to life. 1. AI Agents Automating Repetitive Operations AI agents are intelligent systems that automate customer service, order processing, and post-purchase communication. These agents reduce human workload, allowing teams to focus on innovation, growth, and brand strategy. Case in Point:One of our clients in the consumer electronics space is leveraging AI agents to efficiently handle support queries, manage product exchanges, and deliver personalized recommendations. This strategic use of automation has resulted in faster response times, improved customer satisfaction, and increased retention, particularly noticeable during high-traffic sales events like Black Friday and holiday seasons. 2. Hyper-Personalization via Predictive Analytics With predictive analytics and real-time behavioral data, AI enables businesses to create one-to-one shopping journeys. These insights allow brands to recommend the right products at the right moment before customers even realize what they need. Case in Point: A beauty and wellness brand analyzed customer skin types, browsing history, and purchase frequency to deliver hyper-personalized bundles. This increased average cart size and reduced bounce rates across mobile sessions. 3. AI-Powered Sizing and Fit Recommendations Return rates are a challenge for fashion, accessories, and footwear brands. AI can mitigate this by offering size suggestions based on customer measurements, past orders, and common fit issues. Case in Point: A luxury clothing label deployed an AI sizing model that analyzes customer profiles and product types to recommend the ideal fit. This reduced return rates by over 30% and helped build buyer trust especially with new customers. 4. Visual Search & AI-Powered Product Discovery Visual AI allows users to search using images instead of text transforming how customers browse and find products. It’s especially impactful in design-led categories like home décor, jewelry, and fashion. Case in Point:A fine jewelry retailer implemented visual search, enabling customers to upload photos and receive visually similar options. This enhanced product discovery, increased engagement time, and improved mobile conversion rates. 5. Voice Commerce 2.0 – Context-Aware Conversations Voice-assisted shopping is becoming more intelligent. Context-aware AI understands user intent, enabling natural conversations that help users reorder, compare, and discover products without lifting a finger. Case in Point:A home utility brand enabled voice-activated shopping via smart speakers. Customers could reorder essentials, get voice updates on order status, and receive spoken alerts on relevant deals all without opening an app. The result? A seamless, hands-free experience that aligned perfectly with on-the-go lifestyles. 6. Generative AI for Scalable Content Creation Voice commerce is evolving beyond basic commands. With context-aware AI, users can now interact naturally placing orders, checking statuses, or exploring offers using just their voice. It’s shopping that fits into everyday moments, effortlessly. Case in Point: An online furniture store used AI to generate consistent and keyword-rich product narratives. This allowed faster product launches and better organic reach without increasing content team size. 7. AI for Post-Purchase Engagement & Retention AI isn’t limited to the pre-sale journey. Post-purchase automation is helping brands retain customers and turn them into loyal advocates through intelligent workflows and personalized follow-ups. Case in Point: A D2C fashion brand deployed AI to send tailored follow-up emails, ask for product reviews, and suggest complementary items based on recent orders. This increased repeat purchases and helped create a lifecycle marketing flow without manual effort. 8. Dynamic Pricing & Smart Targeted Campaigns AI monitors market shifts, competitor behavior, and consumer trends in real-time empowering brands to implement flexible pricing and launch segmented marketing campaigns that convert. Case in Point: In the athleisure category, brands are using AI to auto-adjust pricing during promotional windows and deliver targeted offers to returning users. This strategy has driven up ROI while reducing cart abandonment rates. Final Thoughts ",

AI in Fashion Market Highlights: Personalized Shopping: AI enhances customer experiences with tailored recommendations and virtual try-ons. Supply Chain Optimization: AI streamlines operations, reducing costs and improving efficiency. Trend Forecasting: AI analyzes data to predict fashion trends and innovate designs. North American Leadership: Strong AI investments and tech giants drive market growth. The effective use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing fashion brands, which is being driven by the consumer demand for personalization, sustainability, and efficiency. With the US fashion market at the forefront, the adoption of AI technologies is accelerating, which is further being fueled by a tech-savvy consumer base, a robust technological infrastructure, followed by significant investments from both public and private sectors. The incorporation of AI is one of the significant factors influencing the growth of several segments of the fashion business. AI technology boosts client satisfaction and loyalty via personalized shopping experiences using data analysis. AR & AI Virtual Try-On and Fitting Room solutions enhance the customer shopping experience, reducing return times and ensuring a high level of certainty. The industry will continue to benefit from supply chain optimization, dynamic pricing, fraud detection, trend research, and new product innovation, focusing on sustainability. These initiatives will help address rapidly changing customer expectations by improving secure transactions and operational efficiency. The fashion market is a fluid environment that also improves standards, although the introduction of AI has a broader impact on driving this industry. The Booming US AI in Fashion Market: A Snapshot of Growth According to the USCC data of April 2023, it is anticipated that more people will be shopping online and being influenced in their buying decisions by social media. By 2022, the fast fashion business was expected to account for $106.4 billion in revenue. Using a centralized and fast-moving supply chain and leveraging the search histories of consumers on its app, Shein is taking major market share in the United States, competing with rivals such as Zara and H&M, according to the same source. Other fashion-related Chinese businesses are taking an interest in this AI business model. Governmental investments in the AI-based technology sector witnessed major growth within the past few years, especially in countries like the USA, UK, India, Canada, and Japan. The UK Government introduced AI Tech Missions Funds, under which the government allotted about GBP 110 million, whereas about GBP 900 million was allotted for AI Research Resources. Some of the major market players operating are Microsoft Corporation, Amazon Web Services Inc., IBM Corporation, Intelistyle, Stylumia Intelligence Technology Pvt. Ltd., LALALAND, True Fit Corporation, Stitch Fix, Inc., ZMO.AI, Zalando SE, Neural Fashion AI, and Resleeve, among others. The Increasing Popularity of AI in the Fashion Industry The adoption of AI is expected in fashion, with more picky customers seeking unique style preferences and experiences. AI-led recommendations, influencer inspiration, and customizable products are driving a growing proportion of this shift. Rather than thinking about a one-size-fits-all, current times focus more on the individual. As such, consumer demands lean towards personalization, and brands respond by adopting innovative technologies. It demonstrates a significant shift in how people connect with the industry they engage with, and also deeply offers their input for advancements through data insights. In addition, Mango, one of Europe’s top fashion companies, is pushing the boundaries for its digital transformation with the introduction of Lisa. Lisa is an in-house conversational generative AI platform that was introduced in October 2023. In under nine months, the fashion company developed its conversational generative AI platform that uses a spectrum of models Lisa works with, some proprietary and others open-source. This new platform is built on the backbone of Mango’s tailored interface, similar to ChatGPT, and is intended for use by its partners and workforce. Increasing Global Ownership of Smartphones The major factor propelling artificial intelligence (AI) in the fashion market’s growth is the increasing ownership of smartphones worldwide. With the increasing ownership of smartphones, consumer accessibility to the fashion sector is increasing rapidly. The global smartphone ownership witnessed a major growth, with about 4.3 billion individuals, or about 54% of the total global population owning smartphones, as stated by the G",

Cartier has successfully bridged the gap between traditional luxury and digital innovation by leveraging AI-driven solutions. The brand is setting new industry standards, from personalized shopping experiences and predictive demand forecasting to fraud detection and AI-powered design. One of the key areas where Cartier has integrated AI is personalization, ensuring that customers receive curated recommendations tailored to their tastes. AI-driven predictive analytics have also revolutionized Cartier’s inventory management, reducing waste while optimizing supply chains. Cartier employs AI-powered detection systems that identify suspicious transactions and counterfeit products to combat the growing threat of online fraud. In addition, AI-enhanced virtual try-on technology allows customers to experience Cartier’s products from the comfort of their homes, significantly boosting online sales. The brand also utilizes AI-assisted trend analysis to anticipate evolving consumer preferences and create cutting-edge designs. This article explores five real-world case studies demonstrating how Cartier harnesses AI to innovate, stay competitive, and enhance its brand value in the luxury market. Related: Ways Michael Kors is using AI – Case Studies 5 Ways Cartier Is Using AI [Case Study] [2026] 1. AI-Driven Personalized Customer Experience Challenge Luxury brands thrive on exclusivity and personalized experiences, but providing tailored recommendations at scale is challenging. Cartier wanted to enhance the shopping journey for high-net-worth customers, offering them bespoke suggestions based on their preferences, past purchases, and browsing behaviors. The traditional approach, which relied on in-store interactions with sales associates, was insufficient for modern digital-first consumers. The luxury sector demands exclusivity, and Cartier found itself at a crossroads in the digital era. With an increasing number of affluent consumers shifting to online shopping, the brand needed to ensure that customers experienced the same level of curation and personalization they would expect in a boutique. However, manually tracking customer preferences across different platforms and channels was inefficient and prone to errors. The lack of a comprehensive system meant that customers often received generic recommendations, failing to meet the high expectations set by the brand’s legacy. Additionally, Cartier wanted to harness data from various sources, including website visits, purchase histories, and social media interactions, to understand evolving consumer tastes better. The challenge was integrating AI-driven analytics without compromising the exclusivity and personal touch the brand is known for. Solution Cartier integrated AI-powered recommendation engines into its online platform and mobile application. Using machine learning algorithms, the system analyzed past customer behavior, including purchase history, engagement with specific product categories, and even browsing duration for particular items. Recognizing that AI could bridge the gap between data collection and hyper-personalization, Cartier partnered with leading AI developers to create an advanced machine learning-driven recommendation engine. The system deployed predictive analytics to anticipate customer desires before explicitly expressing them. The AI built comprehensive consumer profiles by tracking digital footprints and combining data points such as browsing habits, past purchases, and engagement with Cartier’s digital touchpoints. The AI also incorporated Natural Language Processing (NLP) and computer vision technologies to analyze sentiment and style preferences from customer interactions on social media and other platforms. The recommendation engine evolved with reinforcement learning, continuously refining its suggestions based on customer feedback. To extend personalization beyond online channels, Cartier equipped its in-store associates with AI-driven tools that provided real-time insights into a client’s tastes and previous interactions. These AI-backed insights allowed store staff to curate bespoke product selections instantly. Result The implementation of AI-driven personalization increased online engagement by 35%, with a significant boost in average order value. Customers reported a more satisfying experience, with a 40% increase in repeat purchases. Furthermore, AI-powered personalization reduced customer churn, as buyers found relevant products faster, strengthening their brand loyalty. By integrating AI into both digital and in-store experiences, Cartier bridged the gap between traditional luxury retail and modern e-commerce. Cartier’s strategic integration of AI transformed cu",

Handled by WPP Media, the initiative embraces a global media strategy led by large-scale out of home displays in major cities, including Paris, New York, London, Shanghai, Seoul, and Las Vegas. This activity is being backed by print collaborations in titles including the New York Times and the Financial Times, with the latter adapting its production to accommodate an over-cover which will not be printed on salmon paper, a first-ever break from the newspaper’s trademark for 132 years. Meanwhile, immersive content is accessible through a QR code integrated into the media strategy, designed to strengthen the interaction between the physical and the digital. These initiatives are supported by targeted activity on social media platforms. Founded by Louis-François Cartier in Paris in 1847, Cartier designs, manufactures, distributes, and sells jewellery, watches, leather goods, sunglasses and eyeglasses. The luxury goods company remained under family control until 1964. It is now a subsidiary of the Swiss Richemont Group and operates more than 200 stores in 125 countries, including what it calls “historical maisons” in Paris, London, and New York City. WPP Media Richemont global account director Jeanne DiMaira said: “We are proud to have supported Cartier in the distribution strategy of this ambitious campaign. Each activation was carefully designed by more than 40 local market teams to enhance the maison’s unique identity and create a lasting global impact.” WPP Media Cartier global lead Caroline Kovacs-Lopez added: “This exceptional campaign is the result of a particularly close and rich collaboration with Cartier, which allowed us to translate their creative vision into an extraordinary global multi-device strategy in every respect, offering a coherent and captivating experience that resonates with the most discerning audiences.” Related stories Spend up 8% as firms raid budgets to fight tariff chaos Bellwether reaction: Are one-to-one channels now king?

Get a Free Quote Our Services → Cartier's Brand Identity and Heritage FoundationCartier's brand identity stands as a testament to the power of heritage brand marketing approach combined with strategic luxury brand mythology creation. The maison's foundation rests on two pillars that have defined its premium brand positioning techniques for over 175 years.Royal Connections and Historical PrestigeLouis-François Cartier established the House of Cartier in 1847, but the brand's royal endorsement marketing impact began materializing in the 1900s when Louis Cartier, the founder's grandson, captured the attention of European aristocracy. The brand's transformation into the \"Jeweler of Kings and King of Jewelers\" occurred through deliberate cultivation of relationships with royal families across Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.King Edward VII of England commissioned Cartier to create the coronation crown for his 1902 ceremony, marking the first significant royal endorsement that would define the brand's prestigious positioning. This single commission established Cartier's reputation among European royalty and triggered a cascade of royal patronage that continues today. The brand's archives document over 15 royal warrants granted by monarchs across different continents, each representing a cornerstone in their heritage brand development process.The cultural significance brand building approach Cartier employs traces back to these royal connections. Prince Rainier III of Monaco's gift of a Cartier tiara to Grace Kelly for their 1956 wedding ceremony exemplifies how the brand became intertwined with significant cultural moments. This strategic positioning created aspirational value that transcends mere product ownership, embedding Cartier pieces into historical narratives that resonate with luxury consumer psychology insights.Cartier's documentary evidence reveals that 12 different royal families across Europe, Asia, and the Middle East have commissioned custom pieces from the maison since 1900. Each commission represents not just a transaction but a cultural endorsement that reinforces the brand's mythological status. The Duchess of Windsor's panthère jewelry collection, acquired throughout the 1940s and 1950s, demonstrates how Cartier's royal connections extend beyond ceremonial occasions into personal relationships with influential figures.The brand's heritage marketing approach leverages these royal connections through strategic storytelling that emphasizes continuity rather than change. Cartier's communication strategy references specific historical moments without dwelling on past glory, instead using these references to validate contemporary relevance. The brand's archives contain over 3,000 documented pieces created for royal families, providing substantial material for brand narrative development strategy.Modern luxury consumer psychology insights reveal that royal endorsements create perceived value that extends beyond craftsmanship or materials.

Studies / LuxuryHow Cartier’s strategy made it the king of luxury jewelersFrom a small Parisian store to the world’s leading luxury jeweler Maison, Cartier’s story takes you behind the curtain of how it became the jeweler of kings, maharajas, and empresses.Written by Tefi AlonsoNovember 25, 2022Table of contents Cartier is the world’s leading luxury jeweler. It designs, manufactures, and sells high-end jewelry, watches, and other accessories. Its headquarters is in Paris, France and Cyrille Vigneron is its current President & CEO. The Richemont Group of Johann Rupert & family owns Cartier.Cartier’s strategy has three elements that have contributed to its success: Its focus on qualityIts distinctive brandingIts commitment to extraordinary customer service. Cartier’s focus on quality is evident in its designs and products. The company uses only the finest materials and the most skilled craftsmen to create its products. This attention to detail has made Cartier’s jewelry some of the most sought-after in the world.Cartier’s distinctive branding is another key to its success. The company has a long history of creating iconic designs that are immediately recognizable. The Cartier “Love” bracelet, for example, is one of the most popular jewelry pieces in the world. Cartier’s brand is synonymous with luxury and excellence.Finally, Cartier’s commitment to customer service is unrivaled. The company has a global network of retail stores and offers a wide range of services, including:Care and adjustmentPersonalization of creationsRepairIn this strategy study, we’ll see how the Maison combined these three elements with unparalleled loyalty to family to take over all the corners of the world.Source: Meshari Alawfi, CC BY 4.0, via Wikimedia CommonsCartier’s market share and key statisticsGrew its brand value by 88% in 2022Annual revenue of more than $1 billion7,500 employees of 90 nationalities within the MaisonBrand value from $6,7 billion in 2017 to $12,4 billion in 2022It has 274 boutiques and three Temples (historical Maisons)Global Jewelry Market Share is estimated to reach $500 billion by 2026 Humble Beginnings: How was Cartier founded?The founder of the Cartier brand is Louis-Francois Cartier.Born in a gunpowder-making family in 1819, he craved formal education but never got the chance to pursue it. His father sent him to work as an apprentice to Monsieur Bernard Picard, a master fabricant of jewels and watches.Apprenticeship in those days was cruel, but it was an opportunity to enter the middle class and live a better life than his father. Cartier proved to be tenacious, and in 1847, at the age of 27, he negotiated a deal with his former boss to buy out the store.Louis-François Cartier studying during his retirement | Source: atelier Nadar, Public domain, via Wikimedia CommonsEven though Louis-Francois Cartier laid the foundation for his posterity to build the family Empire, success wasn’t certain at the beginning.Cartier’s first strategic decisions and Paris’s reformIn the early months of his business, Cartier had very specific challenges that he needed to overcome, and he would focus on doing exactly that.Firstly, Francois was still in debt to Picard and some family members from purchasing the store. Secondly, the Cartier business wasn’t distinguished or popular enough to attract renowned names with deep pockets that could sustain his business. So he realized that his first feasible goal was to establish his business name in the trade.How did he do that?His first move was to register his unique maker’s mark that would distinguish him from Picard on April 17, 1847. However, he knew that his master’s name bore enough respect that he could capitalize on it. So, within a year, Cartier put his name in the directory of Paris de Almanac as the “successor to M. Piccard.”Francois didn’t abandon the craft of making jewels, but he didn’t stop there either. He expanded his stock significantly, offering all sorts of jewelry, from crystal bracelets to diamond earrings and pearl accessories. To keep his business going, and since he couldn’t attract aristocracy, he would sell to his fellow jewelers and other workshops.But Cartier was unfortunate. Just one year after he opened his business, a detrimental, many-month-long revolution in Paris would jeopardize everything. For the next four years, Paris was in chaos, the jewelry market had sunk, and Louis-Francois had closed shop.In 1853, things started to change for the better.How Cartier pivoted and changed clienteleThe political situation stabilized once Napoleon III came into power.Napoleon wished to return France back to its former glory, so he focused on strengthening and modernizing the economy, making strong trade agreements, and rebuilding central Paris to encourage innovation and commercial expansion. As a result, the French middle and upper classes’ wealth increased significantly.At the same time, the salary str",

Maison Cartier’s collection dates back to the opening of Louis-François Cartier’s very first Paris workshop in 1847. And with over 174 years of history, the Maison’s catalog is extensive, with over a thousand wristwatches, some with only slight variations between them. Finding specific models, or comparing several models at once, could take some time for a sales associate working at one of Cartier’s 265 boutiques — hardly ideal for a brand with a reputation for high-end client service. In 2020, Cartier turned to Google Cloud to address this challenge. An impressive collection needs an app to match Cartier’s goal was to develop an app to help sales associates find any watch in its immense catalog quickly. The app would use an image to find detailed information about any watch the Maison had ever designed (starting with the past decade) and suggest similar-looking watches with possibly different characteristics, such as price. But creating this app presented some unique challenges for the Cartier team. Visual product search uses artificial intelligence (AI) technology like machine learning algorithms to identify an item (like a Cartier wristwatch) in a picture and return related products. But visual search technology needs to be “trained” with a huge amount of data to recognize a product correctly — in this case, images of the thousands of watches in Cartier’s collections. As a Maison that has always been driven by its exclusive design, Cartier had very few in-store product images available. The photos that did exist weren’t consistent, varying in backgrounds, lighting, quality and styling. This made it very challenging to create an app that could categorize images correctly. On top of that, Cartier has very high standards for its client service. For the stores to successfully adopt the app, the visual product search app would need to identify products accurately 90% of the time and ideally return results within five seconds. Redefining Cartier’s luxury customer experience with AI technologyWorking together with Cartier’s team, we helped them build a visual product search system using Google Cloud AI Platform services, including AutoML Vision and Vision API.The system can recognize a watch’s colors and materials and then use this information to figure out which collection the watch is from. It analyzes an image and comes back with a list of the three watches that look most similar, which sales associates can click on to get more information. The visual product search system identifies watches with 96.5% accuracy and can return results within three seconds.Now, when customers are interested in a specific Cartier watch, the boutique team can take a picture of the desired model (or use any existing photo of it) and use the app to find its equivalent product page online. The app can also locate products that look similar in the catalog, displaying each item with its own image and a detailed description that customers can explore if the boutique team clicks on it. Sales associates can also send feedback about how relevant the recommendations were so that the Cartier team can continually improve the app. For a deeper understanding of the Cloud and AI technology powering this app, check out this blog post. High-quality design and service never go out of styleToday, the visual product search app is used across all of the Maison’s global boutiques, helping sales associates find information about any of Cartier’s creations across its catalog. Instead of several minutes, associates can now answer customer questions in seconds. And over time, the Maison hopes to add other helpful features to the app. The success of this project shows it’s possible to embrace new technology and bring innovation while preserving the quality and services that have established Cartier as a force among luxury brands. With AI technology, the future is looking very bright. POSTED IN: Google Cloud AI Products",

    "extractedText": "Share The landscape of shopping has drastically evolved over the last decade, and mobile apps are at the forefront of this transformation. As smartphones become increasingly indispensable, e-commerce has adapted, with mobile apps driving 78% of all e-commerce traffic. However, the real magic is happening now with the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI is transforming how we shop, making mobile apps smarter and more personalized. From personalized recommendations to virtual try-ons, AI-driven features are fundamentally reshaping consumer experiences, driving conversions, and influencing brand loyalty. In this blog, we’ll explore how e-commerce mobile apps functioned before AI, the impact of AI on modern shopping apps, and what the future holds for AI-powered e-commerce shopping. We’ll also delve into real-world examples, discussing what works and what doesn’t in AI-powered e-commerce apps. The Pre-AI Era: How Mobile E-Commerce Apps Worked In the pre-AI era, mobile e-commerce was still in its early stages, with retailers focusing on creating functional, easy-to-use apps. These apps allowed consumers to browse products, make purchases, and track orders, but the experience was often generic and limited. Apps generated 3-5× more revenue per user compared to mobile websites. Despite the growth, mobile apps were primarily designed for basic functions: Catalog-based browsing: Search, filters, and category listings were the primary ways users interacted with products. Static recommendations: Some apps used basic “Customers who bought this also bought…” or “Best sellers” lists to promote products, but these were not personalized. High cart abandonment: As the experience was not personalized or optimized, shopping carts were abandoned, particularly on the mobile web. Apps performed slightly better but still faced high abandonment rates. In summary, while mobile apps were driving revenue, they lacked the intelligence to anticipate what customers wanted, leading to higher drop-off rates and less engagement. Enter AI: How Artificial Intelligence is Revolutionizing Mobile E-Commerce The AI integration into mobile shopping apps makes them smarter, more personalized, and more user-centric. Today, AI powers features that significantly improve the customer journey. How does AI improve the shopping experience? Some key AI mobile app benefits include: Personalized Recommendations: AI analyzes user behavior, such as clicks, searches, and past purchases, to serve highly personalized product suggestions. Dynamic Pricing: AI uses real-time data to adjust prices based on demand, supply, or even customer preferences. Visual Search: Apps now allow users to search for products using images, and the app identifies similar items using AI-driven image recognition. Conversational AI: AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants, powered by AI, offer real-time customer support, personalized shopping advice on the app, and even product recommendations. Fraud Detection: AI helps to prevent fraud by analyzing purchase patterns and flagging suspicious transactions. Take this example. In one of the most recent and impactful moves in retail, Target has partnered with OpenAI to launch a full Target shopping experience directly inside ChatGPT. This new integration lets customers browse products, get highly personalized recommendations, build multi-item shopping baskets, and check out using Drive Up, Order Pickup, or shipping, all through natural conversation. Internally, Target has already rolled out ChatGPT Enterprise to 18,000 employees, using AI to streamline customer support, power supply-chain forecasting, support store operations, and enhance digital personalization across its ecosystem. Target’s rapid AI adoption signals a major shift: retailers are no longer experimenting with AI; they’re building AI-first retail models and redefining how product discovery, customer service, and mobile shopping experiences work. The Statistics Behind AI’s Impact AI is making a significant impact on both consumer behavior and e-commerce performance. Here are a few relevant stats: Younger U.S. consumers are rapidly embracing AI-driven shopping: 23% of adults aged 18-39 say they like using AI for shopping, compared to 15% of those aged 40-64, and 24% of younger shoppers have already used AI platforms to search for products (vs. 18% of older shoppers). The gap widens with influence; 41% of 18-39-year-olds have followed recommendations from AI-generated digital influencers, nearly double the 21% among 40-64-year-olds. Most notably, almost half (44%) of younger consumers believe AI-generated digital influencers can promote products as effectively as human influencers, while 30% of older adults share that view. This shows that AI-powered discovery and influencer marketing are becoming mainstream drivers of consumer behavior, especially among younger demographics.

Published Nov. 20, 2025 By Tatiana Walk-Morris Share Copy link Email LinkedIn X/Twitter Facebook Print License Add us on Google Google updated its AI Mode to allow users describe their desired items and receive product recommendations with shoppable product images, pricing and reviews. Courtesy of Google Dive Brief: Google is introducing a batch of AI-driven shopping features in time for the holiday season, the company announced last week. U.S. Gemini app users can now enter search queries to receive shoppable product recommendations, pricing and comparison tables. Google has also updated its AI Mode to let search users describe their desired items and receive product recommendations with shoppable product images, pricing, reviews and other information, the company said in its announcement. Its “Let Google Call” feature calls local stores to verify product availability on a shoppers’ behalf, check prices and inquire about retailers’ promotions. Dive Insight: With Google’s suite of new features, the tech behemoth is delivering on its promise to turn AI into a personal shopping assistant. In May, the company shared its “AI Mode” plans, which allows shoppers to use their photos to virtually try-on items, find the best prices and curate recommendations. Shoppers can use a “track price” button to set up price drop notifications for an item based on their desired size and color, among other options. Google has begun rolling out its agentic AI checkout capabilities for U.S. merchants, the company said in its announcement. Wayfair, Chewy, Quince, and select Shopify merchants are among the first retailers to authorize use of the new tool, but more businesses will soon offer the option. Using Google’s new AI Mode, shoppers can receive a range of intuitive product recommendations based on their conversational search queries rather than precise keywords, the company said. The tool draws on more than 50 billion product listings, with roughly 2 billion updated hourly. Beyond expanding its agentic AI capabilities, Google has integrated AI along consumer shopping journeys. In March, the company announced another set of AI-powered shopping tools. While users can try on pants and skirts with the updated virtual try-on tool, its vision match tool enables mobile users to create AI-generated images of how items may look and receive links to related products. As Google rolls out more AI-powered shopping features, other tech companies and retailers are developing technologies to enable agentic AI purchases. OpenAI recently launched its Instant Checkout feature in ChatGPT, which lets users buy items directly within the platform for U.S. sellers including Etsy and some Shopify merchants. Walmart announced a partnership in October with OpenAI where shoppers can soon make purchases within ChatGPT, as well. As tech titans bridge the process of finding and purchasing new products with AI, the flood of AI tools has begun to reshape the shopping experience for consumers. Nearly two-thirds of consumers have used general-purpose AI technology to guide their online shopping, according to a Bloomreach survey released in March. More than half said their searches had become more conversational. purchase licensing rights Filed Under: Marketing, Technology",

The role of artificial intelligence in e-commerce and its impact on consumer behavior are expected to dominate the three-day event.\"The transition from traditional web or app search to agent-led commerce represents the next great evolution in retail,\" John Furner, Walmart's incoming president and CEO, said in a joint statement with Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichaei.Google's new AI shopping feature works this way: if a customer asks what gear to get for a winter ski trip, for example, Gemini will return items from a participating retailers' inventory.In the case of Walmart, customers who link their Walmart and Gemini accounts will receive recommendations based on their past purchases, and any products they decide to buy via the chatbot could get combined with their existing Walmart or Sam's Club online shopping carts, according to the statement.OpenAI and Walmart announced a similar deal in October, saying the partnership would allow ChatGPT members to use an instant checkout feature to shop for nearly everything available on Walmart's website except for fresh food.Google, OpenAI and Amazon all are racing to create tools that would allow for seamless AI-powered shopping by taking chatbot users from browsing to buying within the same program instead of having to go to a retailer's website to complete a purchase. The race between OpenAI and Google has heated up in recent months.Before the recent holiday shopping season, OpenAI launched an instant checkout feature within ChatGPT that allows users to buy products from select retailers and Etsy sellers without leaving the app.San Francisco software company Salesforce estimated that AI influenced $272 billion, or 20%, of all global retail sales, in one way or another during the holiday shopping season.Google said the AI-assisted shopping features in Gemini only would be available to U.S. users initially but that it planned to expand internationally in the coming months.×Most recent Business storiesFed's Powell says administration threatened him with criminal indictment over Senate testimonyHoliday spending set records despite consumer pessimismConcerns rise over possible damage to graves during Salt Lake City Cemetery roadworkRelated topicsArtificial IntelligenceBusinessU.S.ScienceAnne D'innocenzioMore stories you may be interested in Concerns rise over possible damage to graves during Salt Lake City Cemetery roadwork Here's what was announced at CES 2026 US says it needs to control Venezuelan oil sales indefinitely to drive change",

What began as machine learning algorithms to recommend books has evolved into AI-powered tools that help customers quickly discover and evaluate products in our store.Amazon now offers the broadest selection in retail, carrying hundreds of millions of products, including more than 300 million items available with fast, free delivery for Prime members, across more than 35 categories including home, apparel, beauty, grocery, and household essentials. We offer this vast selection because Amazon customers expect a wide variety of options, but evaluating products and making a choice can take time. Let’s say you’re shopping for a coffee maker in a physical store—you might find five to 10 models on the shelf. In Amazon’s store, there are many more coffee maker options available. For one customer, a red single-serving coffee maker with an easy to clean filter may make the most sense; for another customer, an industrial-sized stainless steel multi-purpose espresso machine may be the perfect choice. Our shopping experience is personalized and designed to help customers find and discover the products that are right for them, using signals including reviews, price, availability, delivery speed, return rates, and browsing and shopping history.Amazon’s next-gen AI assistant for shopping is now even smarter, more capable, and more helpfulRufus can search for products based on activity, event, purpose, and other use cases, and automatically add items to your cart, tell you if you’re getting the best price, find top deals every day of the year, auto-buy items at a set price, and take a handwritten grocery list and add the items to your cart.AI-powered search and discoveryOur traditional search bar has long connected customers to Amazon’s broad selection and low prices, helping them quickly find the right products while sparking exploration and discovery. Over the past couple of years, we have further refined our search capabilities using AI, and our systems now better understand the intent behind a customer’s search. It's not just about matching keywords anymore—it's understanding what customers are actually looking to buy. This AI-powered approach is more effective and more comprehensive, better understanding the full context of what shoppers want.These advancements in our traditional search models have enabled us to rapidly grow and experiment in next-gen search experiences. Our new AI-powered features are making shopping even more convenient by helping customers discover and evaluate products in whatever way feels most natural to them. We take an iterative approach to building and launching these experiences, often rolling them out in beta to test and learn what resonates with customers. If another feature better solves a customer pain point, we evolve and move on quickly.01 / 08Both our feature set and rate of customer adoption continue to grow. For example:More than 250 million customers have used Rufus this year; monthly users are up 140% YoY and interactions are up 210% YoY. Customers that use Rufus during a shopping journey are 60%+ more likely to convert.Review highlights receive hundreds of millions of impressions weekly, and customers who engage with review highlights have increased by 100% year over year.Hear the Highlights—which has expanded from hundreds of products at launch to millions of products currently—has been used by millions of customers who've streamed more than seven million minutes of content, with nearly half of all customers listening to full episodes.Nearly 20% of customers who created Interests added a recommended item to their cart.Photo searches in Amazon Lens have more than doubled since 2023, and the launch of Lens Live has increased engagement in Amazon Lens by 13%.Billions of personalized size recommendations are generated each month for customers.With Alexa+, we’re also seeing customers having deeper, more helpful shopping conversations, and when customers explore items, they are resulting in three times more on-device purchases compared to the classic Alexa.Products available to purchase through our agentic AI experience Buy for Me have increased from 65K at launch to over half a million presently, and we’re seeing positive customer response as we show selection found both on- and off-Amazon.We use AI in many ways to make shopping in our store more convenient for customers—here are some of the ways customers are using AI-powered features to shop:Rufus – The all-in-one AI assistant for shoppingRufus, our AI assistant for shopping, helps you shop smarter by answering an",

The role of artificial intelligence in e-commerce and its impact on consumer behavior are expected to dominate the three-day event.\"The transition from traditional web or app search to agent-led commerce represents the next great evolution in retail,\" John Furner, Walmart's incoming president and CEO, said in a joint statement with Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichaei.Google's new AI shopping feature works this way: if a customer asks what gear to get for a winter ski trip, for example, Gemini will return items from a participating retailers' inventory.In the case of Walmart, customers who link their Walmart and Gemini accounts will receive recommendations based on their past purchases, and any products they decide to buy via the chatbot could get combined with their existing Walmart or Sam's Club online shopping carts, according to the statement.OpenAI and Walmart announced a similar deal in October, saying the partnership would allow ChatGPT members to use an instant checkout feature to shop for nearly everything available on Walmart's website except for fresh food.Google, OpenAI and Amazon all are racing to create tools that would allow for seamless AI-powered shopping by taking chatbot users from browsing to buying within the same program instead of having to go to a retailer's website to complete a purchase.

    "extractedText": "Top Retailers Boost Profits 39% and Cut Carbon Intensity 21% Over Five Years, Fueled by AI and Connected Retail Advancements LONDON, UK and PALO ALTO, Calif., Dec. 11, 2024 — Retail Economics, an independent economics research consultancy focused on the consumer and retail industry, and SymphonyAI, a leader in predictive and generative AI SaaS products for the enterprise, today released results of new market research that shows powerful business impact from AI adoption. The research warned that data silo barriers to AI adoption are preventing laggard retailers from realizing transformational potential and underscores the importance of approaches like SymphonyAI connected retail to unify data and overcome operational silos for streamlined decision making and efficiency gains. The research looked at the impact of AI in all major areas of retail, including merchandizing and marketing, demand performance, workforce productivity, and store and space and sustainability and waste management. It found that the world’s 200 largest retailers have boosted pre-tax profits by 39.4% and revenue by 31.3% over the past five years while also reducing their carbon intensity (CO₂e produced per $m of sales) by 20.9%. The study of more than 250 retailers across the UK, US, France, Germany, and Canada revealed these gains came through technological investment, including predictive and generative AI. AI-based connected retail gives retailers dramatically increased operational efficiencies that both increase profits and reduce carbon consumption. Connected retail giving users a seamless flow of AI-driven data and insights strengthens retail operations from the supply chain to the shelf. The Retail Economics research found that AI-driven efficiencies in inventory management, route optimization, and waste reduction have supported profit growth while reducing carbon intensity. Food retailers experienced the largest reduction in carbon intensity even as profit margins increased. Grocers using AI-based inventory optimization to prevent over- or under-stocking fresh items and significantly reduce costly and carbon-producing food waste. Retailers believe the impact of AI on sustainability will accelerate over the next two years as they increasingly seek to increase operational efficiency, profitability, and sustainability. Yet survey data reveals that the impact of AI across business functions in top retailers remains uneven as retailers apply AI in isolated operational areas rather than integrating AI across supply chains and operations. Data quality and availability is the primary hurdle to AI adoption, with access to high-quality, relevant data a major issue across most retail functions. With the SymphonyAI connected retail platform and AI SaaS products, retailers gain a seamless flow of data and insights that empower optimized decision-making across every aspect of retail operations—from the supply chain to the store shelf. SymphonyAI connected retail breaks down operational silos, so retailers can make swift, confident decisions without blind spots. Through a source-agnostic data onboarding framework, SymphonyAI connected retail delivers AI-driven insights across critical functions including customer behavior, sales, promotions, assortment, inventory, supply chain, and real-time shelf and store conditions, empowering retailers to enhance efficiency and profitability at every level. This unified approach enables: Profit and Revenue Growth: Retailers using AI-driven tools experience optimized inventory management, precise demand forecasting, and improved customer engagement. Sustainability Gains: Food retailers using AI to reduce overstocking and waste have seen the largest reductions in carbon intensity while growing profitability. Operational Agility: Real-time insights enable swift, confident decision-making that adapts to changing consumer demands and market dynamics. “Connected retail is a must-have for retailers pursuing growth, profitability, and carbon footprint reduction,” said Dusan Rnic, SVP international for the SymphonyAI retail-CPG division. “Historically, retailers lacked the tools to unlock the potential of connecting all their functions due to data overload – which just happens to be the very essence of AI being successful. AI’s potential to improve efficiency, customer engagement, and sustainability is not just a promise – it is now a reality and is a critical evolution in retail’s journey. Retailers must consider unlocking AI’s full potential, not only to lead in the current marketplace, but to support wider goals like sustainability.” Richard Lim, CEO at Retail Economics, added, “Leading retailers are demonstrating that investment in AI and technology can drive both profitability and sustainability. However, lagging companies risk missing out on AI’s broader benefits if they don’t prioritise data quality, system integration, and the right talent. By tackling these issues, retailers can achieve efficient growth that",

These can be solved with predictive analytics and an effective data production plan. They include: Siloed and Static Customer Views Retailers can adopt a complete, real-time strategy by combining traditional data sources with the non-traditional like social media or other external data sources to create valuable insight, resulting in robust fraud detection systems, more effective marketing campaigns, more accurate and targeted churn prediction, and better customer service. This helps them encounter the problems faced by siloed data, where transaction data are separated from web pages, which is again separate from CRM data. Time Consuming Vendor and Supply Chain Management Retailers can adopt real-time analytics and unstructured data sets to combine structured and unstructured data to create more accurate forecasts or automatic reordering, resulting in optimized pricing strategies and more efficient inventory management. Analysis Based on Historical Data Retailers can use prediction and machine learning in real time to create predictions based on current behaviors and trends. This helps them predict the client’s next move. Thus AI helps to adapt automatically to customer behaviors.

    "extractedText": "Things haven’t been feeling great for consumers lately, and many of us are bracing for continued periods of economic uncertainty. Of course, the tightening of shoppers’ pursestrings directly impacts retailers in a number of ways. After seemingly endless increases in inflation, supply chain disruptions, and an ever-looming recession threat, spending is expected to decrease, with people having less money for nonessential purchases. Customer loyalty is also expected to wane, as Women’s Wear Daily reports that 74% of people are trading down to shop with cheaper brands than they’d prefer. Amongst what sounds like a lot of doom and gloom, we see the rise of AI, which offers retailers faster, more accurate, and cost-effective ways to list, market, supply, and sell products. There’s a ton of hype around the technology, making it feel like the big shiny tech obsession du jour, but it also offers a ton of promise. There are many AI solutions that solve smaller issues here and there, but the very best retail AI will integrate into multiple functionalities and improve outcomes across the entire retail operation. This is where AI’s retail promise during economic uncertainty lies. Can AI Foster Connections to Drive Sales? Artificial intelligence can bring humanity to shopping through crafting empathetic experiences that reflect the customer. Lily AI does this by injecting the language of the customer throughout the entire retail ecosystem, connecting people with the exact products they’re looking for. This helps drive sales, of course, but it also fosters brand loyalty by making consumers feel seen in highly personalized retail experiences. Personalized experiences are critical to get right. 66% of consumers say they’ll leave a brand if they don’t receive a personalized shopping experience. Meanwhile, revenue increased by 90% on average when brands invested in digital customer engagement. In those aforementioned metrics alone, we see a big opportunity for AI to impact profitability. Even beyond personalization and fostering brand loyalty, artificial intelligence impacts other areas of retail marketing, forecasting, shopping, and more. Here, we dive into key ways AI boosts profitability across the entire retail chain, delivering real value during economic uncertainty with measurable, quantifiable results. How Does AI Boost Retail Profitability During Economic Uncertainty? Here, we dive into a few ways AI boosts retail profitability in a world where the only constant seems to be a future full of economic uncertainty. Demand Forecasting As one of the most critical parts of the retail process, merchandising teams can be assisted by AI to make stronger purchasing decisions. Lily AI’s algorithms analyze historical sales data, market trends, and external factors (like those economic conditions we’ve discussed so much) to accurately predict product demands. This helps teams in merchandising departments optimize their inventory levels, reduce stockouts, and minimize excess inventory costs. Personalized Recommendations & Marketing Much like the brand building and loyalty fostering we discussed earlier, AI helps retail marketers create personalized campaigns that feel tailored to individual consumers’ preferences and behaviors. We can see this at play in product recommendations, which when done right, provides massive upsell opportunities. By analyzing customer data, AI recommends products that people are more likely to purchase. These are based on their own personal styles, preferences, and historic purchases. Even before consumers reach your site, your Google Search efforts can be enhanced by AI’s insertion of customer-centric language throughout product details, landing pages, and your online store. Just as any classic Google Search operation works, more people are driven to your shop . . . but thanks to the supercharged pace and attribution details provided by AI, the net retailers cast with it is wider than ever before. Super-Charged Search Systems Continuing on the topic of enhancing the actual online shopping experience, AI-powered technology supercharges your on-site search. Because products are enhanced with customer-focused language—which includes product details like fit, texture, and closures, as well as timely trends and subjective synonyms—people can pin-point exactly what they’re looking for by simply searching for it on your site. By using a combination of AI, large language modeling, and computer vision, Lily AI serves people the exact products they’re looking for. When using AI-powered on-site search, products will feel personalized and tailored to each individual shopper’s needs. Website usability is at its peak, and the right products are connected to customers quickly and easily. Content Generation Saves Time & Enhances Productivity While we’ve talked about driving sales thus far, we cannot neglect to mention that AI offers big opportunities for saving time and enhancing productivity. These savings can have a h",

Leigh Buehler | 03/04/2024 Many consumers are aware of the profound transformation the retail industry is undergoing. By simply walking through your favorite stores, you can see that artificial intelligence (AI) technology in almost every area of retail. From enhancing the customer experience to optimizing operational processes and inventory management, AI has become a powerful tool for retailers looking to stay competitive in the dynamic retail landscape. Better Customer Insights by Using AI in RetailCompanies are putting a heavy focus on using AI to help with the customer experience. According to Retail Dive, Tractor Supply® CEO Hal Lawton stated that his company has “leveraged AI within its supply chain, human resources, and sales and marketing activities.” This company has a primary focus on customer service, so AI has aided Tractor Supply in improving their customer service.Tractor Supply uses an AI-powered tech assistant known as “Gura,” which stands for great, uncover, recommend, and ask. Any store associate can use this tool to bring high-quality service to customers.For example, imagine that a customer wants to find a type of dog food that helps with sensitive skin. A store associate can then use Gura to determine which foods would be the best fit for the customer, as well as find the inventory levels and price for a type of food in real time. Personalized Shopping ExperiencesOne of the key advantages of integrating AI in retail management is its ability to offer personalized shopping experiences. AI algorithms analyze vast amounts of valuable customer data – including purchase history, browsing behavior, and preferences – to create individualized recommendations.Amazon® excels in the use of AI technologies to create personalized customer recommendations. Its AI software uses machine learning to suggest products based on a customer's past purchases and the behavior of similar users. This software not only enhances customer satisfaction, but it also drives sales by presenting relevant items to shoppers based on business intelligence information.Amazon’s new notice of “high return rate” also helps customers redirect their search to the customer reviews section of a product page to help customers determine if an item is worth purchasing or if they might end up returning it. This use of AI also helps to control Amazon’s reverse logistics and inventory systems. Predictive Analytics for Demand ForecastingBusinesses can optimize their inventory management systems by using artificial intelligence for demand forecasting. AI analyzes historical sales data, market trends, and external factors. Then, it predicts future customer demand for products with a higher accuracy rate than traditional methods of forecasting.A great example of this data analysis is the use of AI by Walmart® to predict which products will be in demand during specific seasons. This type of high-quality analysis allows for better stock planning and reducing instances of overstock or stockouts.According to Chief Information Officer Dive, AI enhances Walmart’s daily supply chain workflows and anticipates cycles in demand, especially during peak events or unexpected events in customer traffic.However, it’s important to note that Walmart needed a multiyear approach to collect enough data and develop the software to create flexible algorithms for its AI tool. Using AI was a large investment of time, money, and resources, but its use has paid off for Walmart by creating a more seamless shopping experience for customers. AI-Driven Operational EfficiencyArtificial intelligence technologies can streamline various operational processes within an organization, which is particularly useful for leading retailers. The goal is to achieve better resource utilization, reduce costs, minimize errors, and increase productivity. Supply Chain OptimizationUsing AI for supply chain management provides real-time visibility and predictive capabilities. Retail businesses can use AI in their automated inventory management to track shipments, monitor inventory levels, and identify potential bottlenecks in the supply chain. As a result, operational efficiency improves and costs are reduced.According to Thomasnet, Swedish fashion retailer H&M® leverages AI to optimize its supply chains, analyze trends, and forecast demand, enabling the company to quickly respond to changing market demands and minimize lead times. The company’s AI tool is perfect for fast fashion; its software captures data from search engines and blogs so that AI algorithms can predict and analyze trends.The data aids H&M’s leaders in making retail operations decisions on how much to buy, when to buy it, and where to place it in the stores.

For leaders, the mission is singular: to protect the bottom line in a market where external costs, particularly tariffs, can erode margins overnight. Traditional pricing models, reliant on static data and historical markups, simply cannot keep pace with this velocity of change. This growing gap between market speed and operational agility has made one thing clear: margin recovery isn't guesswork; it's a structured, measurable process powered by artificial intelligence and data engineering. The era of historical markups is over. In today's volatile market, margin protection requires moving beyond reactive spreadsheets to proactive, predictive intelligence. AI is the non-negotiable engine that transforms complex external shocks like sudden tariffs into manageable, micro-level pricing and assortment adjustments, ensuring retailers don't sacrifice customer trust while safeguarding profitability. The 3 Pillars of AI-Driven Margin Resilience In our experience, there are three critical areas where AI transforms cost absorption into competitive advantage: 1. Predictive and Dynamic Pricing Optimization Tariffs and supply chain disruptions represent abrupt cost increases that cannot be addressed with blanket, reactive price adjustments. The risk is twofold: set the price too high and you lose customer loyalty; set the price too low and you hemorrhage profits. AI-driven systems solve this by analyzing a multitude of variables in real time, including competitor price moves, local demographics, and crucial price elasticity models. This capability allows retailers to differentiate between key value items (KVIs) and insensitive items. By running dynamic scenarios, AI allows retailers to anticipate tariff impacts and adjust pricing with precision, ensuring costs are recovered without unnecessarily reducing demand. 2. Automated Tariff and Supply Chain Compliance The complexity of global trade rules, especially tariff classification, is a major source of financial risk. Manually classifying thousands of SKUs is tedious and error prone, resulting in penalties. To combat this, AI and machine learning can instantly analyze product attributes, assign correct tariff classifications, and provide real-time smart notifications when trade policies change. Additionally, advanced data engineering platforms are required to integrate external data, such as geopolitical shifts, trade agreements, and commodity cost indices, directly into the planning engine. This creates an intelligent supply chain control tower that shifts from a reactive system to one focused on autonomous interventions. If a tariff is imposed on a key raw material from Supplier A, the system can autonomously identify and model cost-effective alternatives from Supplier B, minimizing financial impact and ensuring production continuity. 3. Strategic Assortment and Promotion Optimization As costs rise, retailers must reassess their product mix to focus resources on high-performing SKUs. AI-powered assortment planning identifies top-selling, high-margin items and flags underperformers. By reducing assortment width and prioritizing high-demand items, retailers avoid overcommitting to costly inventory that may require deep markdowns in the future. Furthermore, AI models optimize promotional activity, identifying where and when a discount will maximize volume without undue margin erosion, instead of broad discounts that unnecessarily cut into profit. The Path to AI-Powered Outcomes For C-suite and technology leaders, the adoption of data and AI is no longer an option; it's a mandatory move to build resilience. It's about evolving the organizational mindset from simply managing costs to engineering profit. By integrating AI-driven insights with human judgment, retailers can transform external unpredictability into a measurable advantage.

Physical retail has had to innovate to evolve to overcome consumer sluggishness, a pandemic, and countless disruptive technologies in the last couple of years alone. The industry’s resilience and progress can largely be attributed to advanced data and predictive analytics systems, which enable data-driven decision-making, strategizing, and, ultimately, overcoming.Internet of Things (IoT) technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) provide valuable store insights. AI gives businesses unparalleled access to high-level organized data, leading to improved retail operations, new business opportunities, and more seamless in-store experiences. It is no wonder that AI has driven an additional estimated $40 billion in revenue for the retail industry over a 3-year period.Now, as physical retail finds its feet and begins surpassing pre-pandemic performance, AI is doing more than simply keeping stores afloat. AI technologies are helping retail businesses become more competitive than ever before. READ MORE: Generative AI’s Effect On Brick-And-Mortar RetailInsights Into Competitor PerformanceAI-driven competitive insights enable retailers to take their insights for their own stores and access that same view for their competitors. Technology leaders in this category offer competitive data sets that enable customers to analyze what is working for their competitors at a store level and in their trade areas. This information can be utilized for strategic planning, store operations, real estate, marketing, and more.This level of insight previously required extensive data ingestion and teams of data scientists to comprehend competitive performance, assuming that data was even accessible. Now, with the help of new technologies, this process has been simplified. At pass_by, this is done by measuring foot traffic to thousands of US brands and augmenting the foot traffic with over 10 unique demographic and psychographic datasets to provide unique insights into competitive performance. The newest foot traffic model can overlay intricate psychographic and demographic data onto foot traffic data to offer previously unavailable competitive insights. Previous attempts to do this have often been unreliable, messy, and simply incorrect. This streamlined, ultra-accurate data then enables competitive intelligence across several different teams, from store ops to real estate. Moreover, AI is added into the mix to provide a predictive element to this model, allowing retailers to view forecasts of future performance patterns months into the future.Ultimately, this technology allows retailers to enjoy the same richness of their first-party data, but with regard to their competitors. This presents the new frontier in in-store analytics wherein foot traffic is taken to new heights with a layered look into how competitor brands are performing now and into the future.Empowering Retail WorkersIn the past, obtaining precise predictions and gaining competitive insights would have required a more manual data science approach, likely involving some form of machine learning (ML) and large teams of data scientists. However, with more advanced models, it's possible for the models to 'learn' and use this capability not only to measure more accurately but also to assist retailers in predicting future events. This is where AI can be beneficial in supporting workers’ goals and innovation initiatives.Massively time-consuming tasks like data management and processing can now be executed accurately by AI, thereby lightening the load on the labor force. Critically, AI enables the rapid processing of raw data, making it accessible to workers in a manageable and actionable format. As a result, AI democratizes these once-inaccessible insights and empowers individual stores to compete with some of the largest retailers in the world.For example, AI-processed insights can be shared with store teams ahead of peak shopping periods or key occasions. These learnings and predictions can help brands anticipate which of their stores will see an increase in foot traffic, allowing them to plan ahead and adjust their staff allocation to maximize customer satisfaction.WATCH NOW: Retail Leaders On The Power Of In-Store AnalyticsBusting AI MythsWhenever a new technology is introduced, there has been a heady mix of concern, excitement, and trepidation. From the first factory to the smartphone, innovation ushers in anxiety. AI has not been immune from these reactions. According to Forbes, some key AI concerns are privacy, bias, job displacement, economic inequality, and manipulation.However, AI is central to the evolution of in-store analytics and, in turn, physical retail.

AI can enhance retail accuracy by optimizing inventory management, customer insights, operational efficiency, and price optimization. These improvements can lead to reduced stockouts, increased sales conversion, decreased operational costs, and improved customer satisfaction. Companies are working to find ways that they can be more efficient and improve operations through the use of AI. This effort is reflected in the fact that nine out of 10 companies now utilize AI or are assessing the possibility for use of AI, often fueled by advanced data and predictive analytics. Jeff Vagg, Chief Data and Analytics Officer at North says, “AI isn’t just about automation. It is about enabling real-time intelligence across the business. But it only works if the data is there to support it. For retailers and small-to-medium businesses (SMBs), quality data is the engine, and AI is what turns it into faster decisions, sharper customer insight, and the agility to compete in a dynamic market.” Advances in POS systems, often powered by the Internet of Things (IoT) and AI, can now provide retailers with invaluable insights, leading to operational improvements and the creation of new revenue streams—an estimated $40 billion over just four years.Challenges and opportunities For SMBs and larger retailers alike, AI presents both significant opportunities and real challenges. While adoption can seem daunting due to perceived costs and complexity, the potential benefits—like enhanced customer experiences, streamlined operations, and increased competitiveness—are substantial. However, it's important to recognize that AI, particularly Generative AI, is still very much in development and not yet always reliable. There is a wide range of accuracy levels across generative AI tools, and recent studies have highlighted notable shortcomings. A 2025 study found that among queries made of eight major generative search engines, the average error rate was as high as 60%. For example, Perplexity answered 37% of queries incorrectly, while Grok 3 had an error rate of 94%. Chatbots across the board were often “confidently wrong,” sometimes failing to retrieve the correct information or citations. Not every AI tool lives up to its promise, therefore, businesses should carefully weigh the opportunities and risks of using AI to determine if it's a good fit.Overall benefits of AI AI can offer many benefits for the retail and SMB sectors, such as:Improving the customer experience: Through personalized interactions and marketing.Streamlining operations: By automating routine tasks and optimizing inventory.Driving sales: Via targeted advertising and dynamic pricing.Enhancing decision-making: With data analysis and business intelligence.According to NVIDIA, 82% of retailers are either utilizing or evaluating generative AI, and over half have already integrated it into their production processes. Retailers can significantly improve inventory management by using AI to assess historical sales trends along with external variables like weather conditions, local events, and global trade rules. This evaluation allows businesses to make strategic decisions about product stocking, so they can effectively meet customer demand and optimize inventory levels.Key areas to leverage AIPersonalized customer experiencesAI is reshaping how retailers interact with customers by creating tailored experiences that drive engagement and loyalty. Let's take a closer look at how personalization is transforming the retail landscape. Personal recommendationsAI analyzes customer data, including browsing and purchase history, to provide personalized product suggestions and tailored offers. This level of personalization enhances cross-selling and upselling opportunities, making the shopping experience more engaging and relevant for each customer. By understanding individual preferences and behaviors, businesses can craft offers that resonate with consumers, ultimately driving higher sales and customer satisfaction.AI-powered customer serviceIn today's competitive market, exceptional customer service is a key differentiator. AI-driven solutions can offer innovative ways to enhance service delivery and facilitate customer satisfaction. Optimized operations and efficiencyThe 2025 NVIDIA report states the evaluation and adoption of AI in retail continues to grow, with 89% of respondents in 2024 reporting that their company either actively uses or is in the process of assessing AI for potential use. This is an increase from 82% in 2023. aPotential benefits of AI include streamlining processes and optimizing resource allocation. For example, AI-driven demand ",

How Integrated eCommerce Platforms Can Accelerate GrowthKore TechnologiesFacebookXLinkedInOver the last decade, eCommerce has become a vital aspect of most product-oriented businesses. In 2023, eCommerce saw an estimated 1.8% increase in sales from 2022, equating to nearly 6 trillion dollars in revenue [1]. Knowing this, many companies have turned to various enterprise commerce solutions to maintain and improve their sales. Yet adopting the wrong eCommerce platforms has presented many organizations with issues, especially concerning their systems and data connectivity. One of the biggest hurdles organizations face with eCommerce platforms is how to maintain their business data. For companies looking to scale, having fast, reliable, and accurate access to eCommerce data is imperative. It can help improve customer experience, elevate business decisions, and make profit and growth more achievable. So how can you ensure strong, reliable, and accessible eCommerce data? One of the best methods to do so is utilizing integrated eCommerce platforms. What are Integrated eCommerce Platforms?An integrated eCommerce platform is one that connects the front-end of your business to your back-office systems. This means that it can exchange, organize, and utilize data between systems and applications like your ERP, CRM, transportation warehouse managing systems, etc. By integrating with your back end, you can ensure timely and consistent data across your organization and customer-facing platform. It can help you keep up with inventory, pricing, and sales, providing a clear advantage over non-integrated platforms. Why Choose Integrated eCommerce Services?One of the most important aspects of an integrated eCommerce platform is the improvement of customer experience. According to Digital Commerce 360, surveyed companies found that customer-friendly eCommerce websites saw buyers spend 62% more on their products [2]. Clearly, providing customers with quality shopping experiences is vital toward boosting sales. Integrated eCommerce solutions can enable these quality experiences by providing optimized, self-service capabilities to customers. These services are designed to enhance the performance and ease-of-use of the website, including features like real-time pricing, package tracking, easy checkout processes, online payment tools, and strong website security. For both B2B and B2C buyers, these aspects of an integrated eCommerce platform can give them a strong sense of control over their shopping process. As well, integrated eCommerce services provide a major internal advantage to organizations. Some of these benefits can lead to: Reduced manual labor Increased visibility of customer data Improved data reporting Automated sales processes Overall, these platforms are designed to make it easy for your customers to do business with you. Five Great Benefits of eCommerce IntegrationAs we’ve covered some of the advantages of using integrated eCommerce, here are five additional benefits these platforms can provide: No More Manual Order Entry A major struggle of any business is manually maintaining its order volume. While manual order entry can work, it can also become greatly inefficient and inaccurate. Integrated eCommerce for manufacturers and distributors helps reduce this inefficiency by automating the entry process, eliminating errors, and improving dataflow and speed. Consolidated Inventory and Sales Data A report from IHL estimated 1.77 trillion dollars of lost revenue worldwide caused by inventory distortion in 2023 [3]. However, with an integrated eCommerce platform that connects with your back end, you can ensure that the pricing and inventory data for your organization is accurate. This helps improve customer experience, allowing for real-time updates on pricing and inventory levels as customers shop online. Greater Sales Management With synchronized data flow and accurate customer data, you can optimize your sales management process. This data can help optimize your sales operations and strategies, while also allowing for superior reporting on sales, customer-behavior, product performance, etc. Sustainable Future Having stronger customer experience and less manual data entry means that your business can run more smoothly and efficiently. This will allow your company to grow, succeed, and flourish sustainably in the future. With all your data managed and connected, an AI-driven eCommerce solution could be the perfect choice to scale your company. Enhanced Customer Experience Gaining and retaining customers relies on a good product or service. Surveyed companies with integrated, customer-friendly eCommerce platforms saw a 70% customer retention rate, as opposed to the 49% who that not. When Would You Need an Integrated eCommerce Platform?With so many benefits, why would anyone choose not to have an integrated platform?
