    "extractedText": "Retailers are increasingly striving to outperform competitors and adapt to modern consumer behavior. From cashier-less checkout systems to the adoption of augmented reality for immersive shopping, companies are transforming traditional retail operations to meet modern-day demands. Generative AI, a recent technology, is rapidly becoming a game-changing solution in the retail industry. It helps retailers enhance customer engagement, streamline operational efficiency, and boost profitability in innovative ways. More than 69% of retailers witnessed increased revenue and 72% experienced cost reduction in operations due to using GenAI. Retailers are using GenAI to personalize marketing content, automate supply chains, and even design new products as per consumer preferences (Source: NVidea). This article explores the growing influence of generative AI in retail, delving into its benefits, challenges, and real-world applications. By examining recent advancements and use cases, we will uncover how retailers leverage GenAI to stay ahead in the retail landscape. What is Generative AI? Generative AI is a subset of artificial intelligence that creates new content—such as text, images, videos, or designs—based on patterns learned from existing data. It uses advanced models such as GPT or GANs to generate realistic and contextually relevant outputs, transforming industries such as retail with innovation. Different types of GenAI are available today, each serving a particular purpose. Text generation models such as GPT create human-like text for applications like chatbots, content creation, and personalized marketing. They help brands create attractive messages based on customer preferences. Image generation models powered by GANs design visuals, such as product designs, marketing creatives, or even virtual try-on solutions that enhance customer engagement. These are primarily implemented in the fashion retail industry. Voice generation models, such as text-to-speech (TTS), enhance customer service by delivering lifelike audio through virtual assistants and interactive shopping experiences, making customer journeys more engaging and compelling. GenAI-driven innovations in retail are likely to power virtual try-ons, dynamic pricing models, and real-time inventory optimization. As the impact and adoption increase, it will become even more crucial for retailers to stay ahead of evolving consumer demands while delivering an improved customer experience. Impact of Generative AI on the Retail Industry Generative AI is transforming retail by enhancing customer experience and automating operations through improving decision-making across the value chain. It enables hyper-personalized marketing and smarter product recommendations through immersive virtual try-ons, optimizing inventory and supply chains through back-office workflows. Marketing and Sales Generative AI is revolutionizing marketing by crafting hyper-personalized campaigns based on customer behavior and preferences, generating tailored product recommendations, email content, and advertisements. Retailers leverage AI-generated insights to identify trends and create strategies that target them, optimizing conversion rates and boosting sales. Customer Services Retailers use generative AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants to offer 24/7 customer support. These tools manage everything from product recommendations to order tracking and returns, with immediate and accurate responses. This decreases the dependency on human agents while guaranteeing consistent quality in service. Customer Experience Generative AI enables virtual try-ons, AI-assisted styling, and immersive product visualization to enhance the shopping experience. GenAI personalizes interactions, making customers feel valued and understood. Thus, it strengthens brand loyalty, and drives repeat purchases. Back-office Automation Generative AI automates routine back-office tasks, including data entry, invoice processing, and report generation. By reducing manual intervention, it frees up employees to focus on strategic initiatives, improving overall efficiency and reducing operational costs. Generative AI changes how retailers function, engage with customers, and react to market imperatives.

    "extractedText": "In the dynamic world of retail, generative artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the game. But can it also revolutionize how retail stores operate? In this article, we explore how generative AI can serve as a catalyst for retailers to operate their stores leaner and more cost-efficiently, while providing store associates with enhanced knowledge and decision support. Furthermore, we believe that generative AI has the potential to fuel new growth for retailers, particularly by improving the customer shopping experience through hyper-personalized offers. Here, we delve into the impact of generative AI on store operations and the workforce, showcasing accessible and ready-to-implement use cases that can generate high impact in these early stages of technology adoption. Two key benefits of generative AI in retail store operations The adoption of generative AI in stores brings forth a twofold benefit: driving cost and productivity improvements and fueling new growth. Together, these benefits create a virtuous cycle that propels businesses forward. 1. AI can drive retil cost and productivity improvements Imagine a store where 40% to 60% of human tasks are automated using AI. First-line managers (such as store managers and shift leaders) believe that 45% of their own jobs could be automated by generative AI, which aligns with various expert views. In contrast, entry-level blue-collar employees think only 36% of their jobs could be automated by AI. However, experts believe the potential for automation in these roles is much higher, in the range of 60% or more. Generative AI acts as a catalyst for efficiency and effectiveness in store operations in the following three areas. Streamlining repetitive tasks of store associates. Generative AI can automate recurring tasks, such as employee labor scheduling, predictive maintenance of store equipment, routine customer inquiries (for instance returns or exchanges), or onboarding of new colleagues, freeing up employees’ time to focus on higher-value activities like customer interaction and sales opportunities.Enabling better and faster decision-making by augmenting (not replacing) human expertise with generative AI “copilots.” For example, generative AI can support associates in answering more complex customer questions or supporting inventory management and production planning decisions.Elevating the role of store management by shifting focus from task execution to validation and action-taking. For example, generative AI can support store and department managers through automated reporting analysis, summary of insights, and action planning based on multiple daily store and department performance reports, alerting compliance issues, flagging waste reduction opportunities, or detecting fraud in stores. 2. AI solutions can fuel new retail growth New growth is driven mainly by three types of generative AI solutions. Solutions that support store associates in better serving customers, for example by using generative AI copilots to help answer basic or more complex customer questions (for instance, “Help me find a healthy cereal option for kids under $5.”)Reallocating time freed up by generative AI solutions, for example time savings from automating repetitive tasks and supporting decision-making can be invested in activities highly valued by customers.End-customer-directed sales and profitability-driving generative AI solutions, for example: Hyper-personalized customer outreach, such as promotions and product recommendations, leveraging data at scale for improved relevance; offering unique services like meal inspiration and planning through AI copilots; or redirecting increased productivity toward innovation, particularly in merchandising and marketing functions. Solutions in the last category are primarily driven by leveraging generative AI in upstream functions, such as marketing and merchandizing, and are less prevalent in the hands of store operators. However, as we take an end-to-end view of the impact of generative AI on omni-channel shopping, we did not want to miss mentioning these opportunities in this article. Our most recent research shows that consumers’ interest in user-facing AI solutions is currently limited. This is particularly driven by concerns around data privacy issues. Personalized promotions, however, are an area of high interest and where generative AI can unlock material benefits. Despite limited interest, retailers should still find value in exploring generative AI solutions and building capabilities because, at some point, customers will be interested. How generative AI can boost productivity and empower store workers Imagine equipping every store associate with a tool that amplifies their capabilities. That’s the promise of generative AI. Unlike traditional large language models (LLMs), generative AI is accessible for the masses, easy, and user-friendly. Implementing generative AI into stores does not require over-engineered change management",

Retailers and consumer brands are at various stages of this digital journey, each seeking tailored solutions to propel their businesses forward. To kick-start digital transformation, organizations need data-based insights that help them deliver on business outcomes. Accessing and acting on these insights is simpler than ever because of technologies such as data lakes, machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI). Elevating retail to new heights with generative AI In the dynamic world of retail and consumer goods, generative AI is a catalyst for transformative change. It’s transforming how companies interact with customers, manage operations, and drive growth. The potential of generative AI is incredibly exciting, with Goldman Sachs forecasting a 7-percent increase in global GDP and productivity growth of 1.5 percentage points over the span of 10 years. Automating product marketing Retailers and consumer goods brands can use Amazon Bedrock, large language models (LLMs), and multi-modal models for intelligent product analysis and descriptive writing. These models can ensure product accuracy, as well as optimize product descriptions for search engine optimization across online product portfolios. Take The Very Group (TVG), for example. TVG, a leading multi-brand online retailer in UK, offers customers access to thousands of products—across categories such as clothing, homeware, and electronics—through its popular ecommerce websites. It transformed its product-development process by developing a generative AI system to bolster TVG development. The system uses Amazon Bedrock, LLMs, and multi-modal models to analyze products and create content for TVG copywriters. This improved productivity by condensing development-processing times and increasing the quality of product descriptions. Empowering customer service Retailers are also striving to improve the customer experience both online and in stores. In a 2021 Qualtrics survey, 80 percent of customer respondents said they’ve switched brands because of a poor customer experience. Behind the scenes, AI-powered chatbots and customer service solutions are redefining personalized consumer interactions. With Amazon Web Services (AWS) contact center solutions, organizations can use chatbots to assist web customers almost instantly, improving customer satisfaction while reducing operational costs. And with Amazon Q in Connect, a generative AI assistant suggests agent responses and actions to address customer questions, providing faster issue resolution and improved customer experience. As Brian Dick, Senior Manager of Customer Care at Orbit Irrigation, said, “To resolve customers’ questions, our agents spend two to three minutes per interaction searching through several different sources of knowledge…. Amazon Q in Connect will create 10–15-percent time savings on every contact, and the increased number of calls handled every hour is expected to translate directly into costs savings for Orbit.” This personalized approach not only boosts customer satisfaction, but also cultivates loyalty. Another company revitalizing customer service is DoorDash. In early 2024, DoorDash deployed generative AI–powered self-service in its Amazon Connect contact center. DoorDash used generative AI to strengthen its customer support experience, particularly for Dashers, its delivery drivers. Faced with a high volume of requests from consumers, merchants, and Dashers, the company sought to improve its self-service options. DoorDash collaborated with AWS in its Generative AI Innovation Center, developing a voice-operated, self-service contact center solution within two months. Using Amazon Connect and Amazon Lex, DoorDash created an interactive voice response system that has reduced agent transfers by 49 percent. DoorDash also increased first-contact resolution by 12 percent, leading to better CX and $3 million in annual operational savings. However, many calls still required live agent assistance, prompting DoorDash to further enhance self-service capabilities. Since Dashers prefer phone support for quick help while on the road, DoorDash focused on shortening response times. It implemented generative AI through Amazon Bedrock, which helped answer common questions quickly, improving efficiency and trust in self-service. This initiative not only streamlined support, but also reinforced DoorDash’s commitment to empowering local economies and enhancing CX for its user base of more than 37 million consumers and 2 million Dashers.

    "extractedText": "Aunique shopping experience is a value that every online store manager should bear in mind in order to keep customers and constantly increase conversions. Various forms of personalization are used in many industries for numerous purposes: starting from marketing through streaming services to eCommerce. The main role of personalization in an online store in the year 2021 is to boost sales and improve the user experience (UX). It also works as a great way to engage undecided customers, reduce the number of abandoned shopping carts or increase the number of transactions among first-time store visitors. In other words - a modern store is a personalized store. Personalization vs Customization At the very beginning, we need to distinguish between two terms: personalization and customization. In Polish, both terms are translated as the personalization, although the basic principle behind these solutions is completely different. Customization - the user is able to individually choose the options, which have been designed to provide a more personal shopping experience. For example, users who visit the store's website for the first time may be asked what category of products they are interested in so that the offer may be adopted to their individual choices. Personalization - The system decides what content or offers are displayed on the page. The selection of the message is made automatically, based on the history of the user's behavior. This is possible thanks to artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technology, which, together with the information collected about purchasing preferences from previous sessions, is able to select personalized content in real time. In this article, we will focus on the latter solution, i.e. personalization AI/ML.Real-time personalization of eCommerce sites Increasing number of online stores pay more attention to building a good user experience (UX) on the website. A properly tailored offer is a quick way to finalize the transaction, so it is recommended to make sure that the shopping path is personalized at every stage.eCommerce personalization is precisely the process of providing a unique experience in an online store thanks to dynamic content, product recommendations and special offers generated on the basis of behavior, purchase history and other data referred to below. According to a study by Bloomreach, online stores see about 20% increase in sales after the introduction of personalized content. At the same time, as many as 80% of customers are more likely to make purchases in an online store that uses some form of personalization, and 77% of consumers would recommend a brand that provides a personalized shopping experience. It is also an efficient way to build and maintain a long-lasting relationship with customers - according to the same study, as many as 44% of consumers declare that after shopping in a store where personalization is applied, they are more likely to become regular customers.How AI / ML technology supports online store personalization The introduction of personalization based on AI / ML technology may seem like a complicated process that requires the involvement of IT specialists and a high-cost investment. You might think that this is an option reserved exclusively for the largest online stores. Nothing could be more wrong! Effective and easy-to-install solutions are appearing on the market, available for every store with equally advanced online shopping personalization options. If you are wondering how it is possible that when a 45-year-old woman visits a clothing store, she sees different content and an offer on the homepage than a 25-year-old man visiting the same store? It is the real-time personalization that is responsible for this.It is possible thanks to the information collected by cookies. Thanks to cookies, the content of websites is tailored to the user's preferences and individual needs. Important! Cookies used for personalization do not collect personal data. The data analyzed by the AI system does not make it possible to identify users. In order to create personalized content, the collected data should be immediately segmented into categories such as:Demographic data (age, gender, education, etc.), Interests, User behavior on various channels (websites, mobile devices, social media, email and others), History of previously viewed pages in the store, Purchase history in the store, Geolocation (country, city, province), Time (hour, day of the week, day of the month, season of the year).Thanks to the appropriate segmentation, the offers on the store's website can be tailored to a specific user depending even on the time of day. Personalized content on the store's website informing about, for example, a current promotion or sale, may appear in various forms. The most popular formats are: banners, pop-ups, inline content, surveys / forms, infobars. However, when creating content you should not forget about the specific context the t",

Personalization isn’t just a trend—it’s a necessity for businesses that want to stay competitive in the digital space. Brands that successfully implement personalization strategies see increased conversions, higher customer retention, and stronger brand loyalty. An interesting fact? Amazon’s recommendation engine alone is responsible for nearly 35% of its total sales, proving just how powerful personalization can be [1]. Perfect personalized customer experience examples – Amazon and Sephora, Nike and Netflix, Spotify and ASOS, and other popular brands, which are the driving force. By leveraging artificial intelligence, customer data, and behavior analysis, eCommerce businesses create unique shopping experiences that make customers feel valued and understood. What is eCommerce Personalization? eCommerce personalization is the practice of tailoring the online shopping experience to individual customers based on data such as browsing history, purchase behavior, demographics, and real-time interactions. This can include personalized product recommendations, dynamic pricing, targeted email marketing, and localized content. The goal is to create a seamless, relevant experience that increases engagement and conversions. The Difference Between Personalization and Customization in eCommerce Personalization often gets confused with customization. While personalization and customization in eCommerce both aim to enhance user experience, they differ in execution. Personalization is automated and data-driven—businesses analyze customer interactions to suggest relevant content, products, or offers. Customization, on the other hand, is user-driven—customers manually choose preferences, such as selecting product features or adjusting website themes. Together, these strategies create a more engaging and satisfying shopping journey. The Core Levels and Methods of Personalization in eCommerce Personalization in eCommerce can be implemented on three levels. Basic personalization includes name-based greetings in emails. Behavioral personalization adapts based on past purchases and browsing history. Predictive personalization leverages AI to anticipate customer needs before they even express them. There are also two key methods of personalization. Personalization can be achieved through explicit methods, where customers provide input, and implicit methods, which rely on data analysis to infer preferences. What are the 4 Ds of personalization? The 4 Ds are Data, Decisioning, Design, and Delivery—the essential components of an effective personalization strategy. eCommerce Personalization Techniques Dynamic product recommendations– Suggesting products based on browsing behavior and past purchases.

In the competitive landscape of modern business, adopting AI-driven knowledge management systems has transitioned from a luxury to a fundamental necessity.The incorporation of Large Language Models (LLMs) into business frameworks is becoming an increasingly vital strategy for organizations aiming to stay at the forefront of technological advancement.This integration serves a fundamental role in the existing corporate landscape. The requirement for LLM integration stems from its potential to transform knowledge management processes, encompassing the creation, capture, and organization of information that cannot be efficiently done through traditional approaches.It enables businesses to empower their employees by providing faster access to knowledge. Furthermore, it significantly boosts customer service quality through personalized and efficient interactions. LLMs offer deep data insights which are crucial for informed decision-making and strategy development. In terms of content, they are capable of generating a vast array of materials ranging from reports to creative content, thereby streamlining the content creation workflow.Customizing LLMs for Business NeedsThe customization of LLMs for specific business needs involves techniques such as prompt engineering, finetuning, retrieval augment generation (RAG), and integration of knowledge graphs (KGs) into LLMs, allowing these models to be tailored to specific industry requirements. Since pre-training a large language model requires massive datasets and extensive computing resources, it is beyond the capabilities of most businesses. However, businesses can finetune the foundation models on their specific datasets to turn them into domain-specific LLMs.Pre-training vs. finetuning. Most businesses cannot afford to train their own large language model. Although finetuning is an option for creating domain-specific LLMs, it requires additional expertise and constant finetuning for new data. Image by author.Prompt engineering is the most basic approach that companies can adopt for LLM integration. This approach requires crafting the most appropriate prompt (or a chain of prompts) along with a context that represents the company’s data, style, format, role, examples, and/or limitations. This approach can suffice for most business tasks; however, it is limited by the context size of LLMs. Although current LLMs have a very large context window, business data can exceed the context window. In addition, using a very large context is an expensive and inefficient approach.Press enter or click to view image in full sizePrompt engineering: It’s all about crafting prompt(s) and setting the right context. However, a very large context is not only expensive but is also inefficient. Image by author.Retrieval Augment Generation (RAG) is a more practical approach in which the business data is stored in a specialized database, called a vector database. The data in the vector database is stored in the form of chunks (vectors), with semantically similar chunks placed adjacent to each other. The user query is matched with the vector database to fetch the top semantically similar chunks. These chunks are then sent to the LLM along with the prompt. The LLM picks the most suitable chunk in the context of the prompt and produces the final output.Press enter or click to view image in full sizeRetrieval Augment Generation (RAG) — a more practical approach to integrate business data into LLMs and mitigate hallucinations.

Step 1: Choosing the Right LLMGood news—you don’t need to build and train an LLM from scratch. Instead, you can use one that already exists (and there’s a wide range available). From GPT models to BERT variants, each has its own strengths and is built to specific use cases.That’s why your choice matters so much. If you were hanging a picture on your wall and you had a hammer and wrench in front of you, which would you choose? While both are useful, one is the right tool for this particular job. It’s the same with different LLMsYou want to find one that’s been trained to efficiently execute the tasks you have in mind.The first decision to make is simple: use a managed service or host your own.Managed services make it very easy to get up to speed, interacting with an API. Companies including OpenAI and Anthropic expose their LLMs through accessible APIs. Hyperscalers also offer LLM marketplaces, such as GCP’s ModelGarden, and managed LLM services, such as Amazon Q.But managed services aren’t always the best option –commercially, the unit economics of consuming hosted models may not be feasible;functionally, the performance of a hosted model may fall short for your specific use-case;security-wise, the transfer of code or data to a third-party service can be prohibitive in highly regulated or competitive industries.If you decide you are looking to host your own, your first stop should be the Hugging Face Repository.

A Practical Developer's Guide to LLM Integration Report this article Jason Zakarian Jason Zakarian Published Mar 31, 2025 + Follow After months of experimenting with and researching various AI-assisted development approaches, I've realized: IDE integration does not deliver optimal results for professional development, and agentic or \"vibe-coding\" simply isn't ready for prime time, especially in a large scale, enterprise system. We won't even mention legacy code bases that are so interconnected that there are load bearing comments you can’t delete. Additionally, as we see in so many aspects of life, if we hand off our critical thinking skills to a machine, our own machinery will start to fail. Raise your hand if your sense of direction went south after smart phone map apps? (Ok, mine was never great to begin with). We're starting to see evidence of this with AI usage anecdotally as well as from more scientific sources: https://phys.org/news/2025-01-ai-linked-eroding-critical-skills.html#google_vignette So what should we do instead with these powerful new tools? My Current Strategy: Targeted, Context-Specific Bursts I've found that using powerful LLMs like Claude (Sonnet 3.7), ChatGPT(4o, o3-mini) or (insert your current favorite here) in specific, short bursts with precise context yields the best outcomes. Here's why this approach works: Preserves critical thinking skills - You stay in control of architecture and key decisions and continue to work through logic on your own, only asking for assistance when you choose what is needed. Your mind stays sharp and you can actually speak about the code when questions are asked (questions are always asked). Eliminate boilerplate frustration - No more wasting time on repetitive code or trying to remember what the exact syntax was to do that specific thing with that specific package. This is the perfect type of activity that LLMs can and should replace, which leaves you more free to focus on the big picture, and more creative aspects of the project. Think about learning history - there’s a difference between memorizing when an event took place and knowing WHY it happened. The former is far less valuable than the latter. Maintains developer agency - You determine exactly what context to provide. Very rarely is the code directly above or below where you are working going to be truly helpful in solving complex problems. It's possible that other open files might be helpful, but it's also just as likely that there are bad patterns or incomplete solutions that you would rather the LLM NOT copy. When usage is targeted, you decide what snippets are important and what examples you want to follow, which will always produce better results. Why This Approach Succeeds Where Others Fail Research suggests that effective LLM integration requires breaking tasks into smaller, well-defined components rather than attempting to generate entire solutions at once. As one source noted, \"LLMs work best with a defined structure... Following an organized approach helps generate working code without prompting the LLM to re-correct the generated code multiple times.\" The big idea: LLMs work best as targeted accelerators rather than complete replacements for developer expertise. This follows a historical pattern we've seen with transformative technologies: Afterall, the mechanical loom didn't replace textile artisans but amplified their creativity while handling repetitive pattern work, CAD software empowered architects rather than replacing their design sensibilities, and the calculator freed mathematicians from arithmetic to focus on higher-level problem-solving. That's not to say the same worries we have today didn't get raised back then. Calculator protests from the late 80's.

Now to the nuts and bolts: Practical Implementation Tips There are many versions of this advice now that you can find, so allow me to reinforce the most salient parts from my own experience: Craft specific, bounded prompts with clear expectations. At a high level you must make sure that you define: The goal of the conversation, Reasons why you are attempting this goal, Constraints on the goal (do this, not that), Context related to the goal (mockups, examples of output, desired format), and Personal details which might impact the response (A senior developer might need different responses than a non-technical manager) Here's a great short example from Greg Brockman, president of OpenAI, which illustrates this ",

By Ben Rand on May 27, 2025.An analysis of more than 250,000 chat conversations reveals the potential for AI chatbots to improve customer service. Research by Shunyuan Zhang and Das Narayandas.HBSWorking KnowledgeWhen AI Chatbots Help People Act More HumanCan an AI chatbot help customer service representatives, well, be more human? Maybe so, suggests a new study that adds to a chorus of findings on how businesses can best tap the new technology.Researchers at Harvard Business School analyzed a year’s worth of online chat conversations between a meal delivery company and its customers to determine how AI affects response times and customer service. According to their study, AI helped human agents respond to chats some 20 percent faster—improving performance even more for less experienced agents. And, the technology helped humans reply with more empathy and thoroughness—uniquely human service strengths with the potential to positively impact revenue and profitability by making for happier customers.You should not use AI as a one-size-fits-all solution in your business, even when you are thinking about a very specific context such as customer service.Companies from banks to boutiques have been turning to chatbots, hoping that AI can provide faster, cheaper, and more accessible service. However, recent findings point to a growing understanding that AI currently works best as a complement to human intelligence, rather than a replacement. Although AI iterates and improves rapidly, concerns about biased large language models and misleading results suggest that leaders might need to proceed cautiously.“You should not use AI as a one-size-fits-all solution in your business, even when you are thinking about a very specific context such as customer service,” says HBS Assistant Professor Shunyuan Zhang. “As the paper shows, there are boundaries, and the effects of AI vary across different customer intents.”Zhang worked with Das Narayandas, the Edsel Bryant Ford Professor of Business Administration at HBS, on “Engaging Customers with AI in Online Chats: Evidence from a Randomized Field Experiment,” which is forthcoming in Management Science.How AI improves customer serviceThe study focused on the delivery company’s use of an agent-based support AI tool developed by Loris.ai, a New York-based firm that aims to make customer service more human. Some agents received real-time response suggestions from the AI tool, while others did not.The tool began as an AI crisis hotline designed to manage difficult conversations with empathy and appropriate suggestions. It was trained on a database of more than 3 million diverse customer-service situations to recommend responses with four basic steps: an offer to help, an apology, a validation formula, and gratitude.The researchers designed an experiment involving 138 customer service agents at an unnamed meal delivery company. They analyzed 256,934 online chat conversations between December 2020 and November 2021 for efficiency and customer sentiment. Customer sentiment was evaluated by the AI tool based on emotional tone at the beginning and end of the interaction. Agents who used AI-based suggestions experienced:22%Drop in response times, even as agent-customer interactions increased0.45 ptsIncrease in customer sentiment on a five-point scale, compared with agents without AIAmong less-experienced agents, the results were more pronounced: 70%Decline in response time1.63 ptsIncrease in customer sentimentWhen AI works best—and when it doesn’tWhile AI assistance generally led to improved customer sentiment, some types of inquiries showed more benefit than others.The study found that AI improved sentiment when customers asked to cancel their subscriptions. The researchers think this could be because AI recommended alternative subscription options. However, the improvement was less substantial when customers contacted the company with repeat complaints, which suggests that these matters transcended AI’s capabilities.When customers were transferred to human agents after their initial engagement with AI chatbots, the technology responded so fast that some customers felt confused. In those cases, customer sentiment scores improved less—most likely, the authors say, because the transfer happened so quickly that customers thought they were still communicating with a chatbot.“AI helped agents respond to customers more rapidly, which is a good thing,” Zhang says. “But when it’s too fast, customers kind of wonder, ‘is this still AI?’” New ways to harness AIManagers implementing AI tools for employees should focus on the question of “who would benefit more?” Zhang says. The research suggests that AI is effective for:Training new employees in service rolesPerhaps most significantly, the researchers discovered that AI support helped less-experienced agents most.

We'll show you how these practical tools deliver immediate support and drive customer success.\n\n* Share the story\n\nWhile [AI for customer service](https://www.salesforce.com/service/ai/) tools have long helped service teams improve efficiency, the technology has evolved significantly from rule-based chatbots to true [AI agents](https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/what-are-ai-agents/). Yesterday's chatbots offered instant support for common issues, but modern AI agents are a revolutionary step forward. By delivering intelligent, context-aware resolutions, agentic AI is the key to unlocking exceptional customer satisfaction and lowering operational costs. Let's explore why this transition from chatbots to AI agents matters for your business.\n\n## What is a customer service chatbot?\n\nThe difference between the two is best understood with an analogy. A traditional [chatbot](https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/chatbot/) is like a vending machine: it works from a fixed menu of pre-defined, scripted responses. It's effective for simple, repetitive tasks but struggles with any request outside its programming.\n\nIn contrast, an AI agent is like a personal chef. It uses large language models to understand complex requests, reason through problems, and ground answers in your company's unique data. An AI agent handles nuanced conversations and seamlessly hands off issues to a human rep when needed, creating a truly natural experience and freeing up your team for the most complex work.\n\n## What you’ll learn about customer service chatbots\n\n* What is a customer service chatbot?\n* Benefits of customer service chatbots\n* Examples of how chatbots are used to improve customer service\n* Important features to look for when choosing an customer service chatbot\n* Tips for creating a customer service chatbot\n* Trends in customer service chatbots\n* What’s the difference between chatbots and AI agents?\n* How Salesforce can help create better customer experiences at scale\n\n## What are the benefits of customer service chatbots?\n\n* Using customer service chatbots is about more than just efficiency — it's about delivering a superior and seamless [customer service experience](https://www.salesforce.com/service/what-is-customer-service-experience/). These tools achieve this for your customers through five key benefits.\n\n### Faster service and higher satisfaction\n\nWhen your customers have a question, the last thing they want to do is wait. Chatbots provide immediate answers, which boosts your [Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT)](https://www.salesforce.com/service/customer-service-incident-management/customer-satisfaction-score/) and leaves customers with a great impression of your brand.\n\n### 24/7 availability and global reach\n\nYour business doesn't stop at 5 p.m., and neither do your customers' questions. Chatbots offer around-the-clock support, ensuring you're always there to help, no matter the time zone. This constant availability makes your business feel more reliable and responsive.\n\n### Consistent and accurate responses\n\nA customer’s trust is hard to win and easy to lose. A chatbot offers consistency because it follows a rigid, preprogrammed script. However, this consistency breaks down when a query falls outside its predefined tracks.   \n  \nIn contrast, an AI agent provides both consistency and flexibility. By pulling from a single, centralized [knowledge management system](https://www.salesforce.com/service/what-is-a-knowledge-management-system/), it can answer a wide range of questions accurately, ensuring reliable support that builds true customer confidence.This means no more conflicting information, just reliable support that builds customer confidence.\n\n### Personalized customer experience\n\nNo one likes to feel like a number. Chatbots can use customer data to provide a personalized experience that feels tailored and engaging. This personal touch shows customers you understand their needs and helps turn a simple inquiry into a loyalty-building moment.\n\n### Quick issue resolution\n\nLet your chatbots handle the simple, everyday questions. This form of [automated customer service](https://www.salesforce.com/service/customer-service-automation/what-is-automated-customer-service/) allows for quick resolution of common issues and frees up your customer service reps to focus on the complex problems where their expertise is truly needed.

    "extractedText": "With structured data as the foundation, AI enables smarter, faster decision-making across the enterprise. Here’s your guide to future-proof implementation. Retail data is a necessary foundation for CPG operations and decision-making, providing suppliers with crucial visibility into real-time retail and inventory movements across thousands of touchpoints. It’s vital in an age where shopper behavior and product trends are in constant flux. Beyond day-to-day functions, however, the amount of retail data suppliers incur across the omnichannel landscape can be so expansive and granular that it can become overwhelming to analyze and extract meaningful insights from. That could be why AI — known for its efficiency and productivity possibilities — presents such a compelling opportunity for the retail and consumer goods industry, with an estimated potential impact of $400 billion to $660 billion annually; driven by AI-supported strategic growth and cost savings through automation of key functions. This value hasn’t gone unnoticed. Retailers’ investments in AI to realize this value have led to two key developments: consumer technology that personalizes shopping experiences and drives purchase behavior; and new, more robust data infrastructure and reporting solutions to drive supplier success. While the wealth of new data made available by retailers is beneficial, their AI-driven visions also raise the bar for performance, demanding faster response times and fulfillment. AI-powered analytics can accelerate suppliers’ time-to-insight and help them make smarter, faster decisions around demand forecasting, inventory management, and business planning, ensuring the adaptability of their operations. But there’s a learning curve — with over 85% of generative AI projects initiated by companies failing to reach production this year. As we’re beginning to understand, the major roadblock is underdeveloped data that fails to meet the intricate, highly granular requirements of large language models (LLMs) and other similar foundation models. While AI promises extreme automation and industry transformation, thoughtfully structured data is essential for the accurate and integrated use of AI tools in retail analytics. In this article, we uncover how to harness retail data for fast, reliable, and powerful AI-powered insights and offer clear paths that organizations can take to begin realizing enterprise-wide value today. The major roadblock [in generative AI project project production] is underdeveloped data that fails to meet the intricate, highly granular requirements of large language models (LLMs) and other similar foundation models. Data as the foundation For CPG suppliers, retail data sources span retailers and distributors of all types, each with their own disparate nomenclature and structure. Millions of records of highly granular data that tracks inventory and sales from distribution centers through to individual consumer purchases at the store level are generated every day. Crisp’s data platform ingests, normalizes, and harmonizes this data from multiple sources, creating a unified foundation for analytics and decision-making. However, suppliers need to take data preparedness a step further to leverage AI’s power in retail analytics. This is where a semantic layer comes in, building consistent, natural business language around disparate data sources, and enriching it with logic and context tailored to the nuances of a unique industry. The semantic layer adds crucial meaning and context to normalized data. This is because while a generative AI model might recognize terms like ‘Dollar Velocity’ or ‘Share of Category YoY Growth,’ it needs to have the understanding of their precise definitions and business context to contribute actionable insights. The semantic layer explicitly defines these metrics, establishes their relationships, and encodes the underlying business logic, empowering CPG teams to draw insights that seamlessly inform inventory management, merchandising, growth strategies, and more. Recognizing this need, Crisp has created the first semantic layer specifically for the retail industry. This added embedded technology provides the context necessary to transform collective retail data sources into natural language queryable information. It can be utilized across departments for fast, reliable insights regardless of technical expertise, heralding a major unlock in AI-driven efficiency. While a generative AI model might recognize terms like ‘Dollar Velocity’ or ‘Share of Category YoY Growth,’ it needs to have the understanding of their precise definitions and business context to contribute actionable insights.

The numbers tell a sobering story: 73% of consumers use multiple channels before making a purchase, but retail businesses miss the mark on when personalization actually matters. While 66% of companies target first-time visitors with personalized offers, only 38% of consumers want personalization at that early stage.Here's where it gets worse. Despite 85% of organizations increasing their investments in AI in retail last year, only 6% saw payback within twelve months. Three-quarters can't even demonstrate measurable ROI from their digital investments.So how do you bridge the gap between AI investment and actual performance? You start with strategy, not software. You fix your data foundation — focusing on the data integration process — before you build algorithms on top of it. And you focus on decisions that drive margin, not just efficiency metrics that look good in presentations.A Closer Look at Data in RetailThe problem runs deeper than technology. Over 50% of companies point to legacy system integration as their biggest barrier to adopting AI analytics. When consumers shop across three or more digital channels monthly and 32% will abandon beloved brands after one bad experience, fragmented customer data becomes a business-killing weakness.The Analytics-as-a-Service market will grow from $13.3 billion in 2024 to $39.8 billion by 2029. But growth doesn't guarantee results. The truth is, most retailers approach retail AI backwards: they buy technology first to only then wonder why it doesn't work. This creates expensive experiments instead of business value.The ROI Gap in AI and Data Analytics in RetailHere's the uncomfortable truth: 95% of organizations see minimal ROI from their AI investments, and 80% of companies using AI have yet to realize meaningful bottom-line results. That's not a technology problem. It's a strategy problem involving how they handle retail data.Why most AI investments underperformThe failures aren't random. They follow predictable patterns:Fragmented data architecture creates the illusion of insight without the foundation for decisions. When retailers operate with disparate data sources, AI becomes expensive guesswork rather than reliable data driven decision making.Misalignment with operations turns sophisticated algorithms into expensive distractions. Research identifies \"brittle workflows, lack of contextual learning, and misalignment with day-to-day operations\" as primary failure factors. If predictive analytics do not fit how people actually work, they simply don't work.Poor implementation reveals itself in the details. 77% of UK e-commerce retailers admit their AI initiatives need work. The biggest disappointments? AI powered chatbots (29%), data analysis applications (27%), and AI-driven marketing (23%) underperforming expectations regarding customer satisfaction.The problem lies in how the strategy is executed. Companies buy analytics tools for problems they haven't properly defined. AI chatbots, when built with care and consideration, can be a significant boost in customer experience.Short-term expectations vs. long-term valueMost executives expect technology investments to deliver returns within 7-12 months. AI retail analytics laughs at that timeline. The average payback period stretches to 2-4 years, with only 6% of organizations reporting payback in under a year.Yet 91% plan to increase their AI spend this year to keep up with market trends. Why? Fear of falling behind competitors drives investment more than clear financial returns. That's a dangerous foundation for informed decisions.The myth of instant personalizationWant to see the ROI gap in action? Look at personalization. 92% of retailers believe they deliver personalized customer experiences, while only 48% of their shoppers agree. That's not a small measurement error. That's a fundamental misunderstanding of customer behavior.The data gets worse. 53% of consumers report seeing no impact from AI powered analytics driving personalization, and 73% prefer human insight over AI-based recommendations.Most organizations chase immediate cost savings through AI implementation instead of focusing on long-term value creation. As one expert puts it: \"Cost reduction has a hard floor while value creation has no ceiling\". This shortsightedness prevents retailers from developing strategies to enhance customer experiences that could deliver exponential growth rather than incremental efficiency gains.What's Blocking AI Success in RetailWhy do well-funded AI projects still fail?

AI companies should choose pricing models that support revenue and profitability goals, while remaining competitive within the business’ market segment. AI companies have several pricing strategy options to choose from, each with distinct advantages depending on your business model, target market, and product maturity. Prices are set based on a variety of factors, including: Marketing conditions. Customer behavior. Competitive forces. Volume or usage-based variables. Customers already have an appetite for AI solutions. Of marketing leaders, 91% say their teams are already using AI, and 43% of sales professionals use AI in their work. Currently, from a marketing and sales standpoint, I’m seeing companies use AI platforms to help them make better data-driven decisions around their pricing strategies. Pro tips: HubSpot Sales Hub supports flexible payment processing, making it easy for businesses to implement multiple pricing strategies all within a unified platform that connects to the CRM. Dynamic and token-based pricing capabilities are a part of HubSpot’s robust integrations ecosystem. Pricing Strategies that Work Well for AI Companies AI companies have different pricing considerations than other businesses. In fact, AI pricing strategies need to factor in computational costs, rapid product evolution, and diverse customer needs. However, when picking an AI pricing strategy, most companies choose one of the following approaches: Usage-based pricing. Tiered subscription pricing. Freemium pricing. Value-based pricing. Or a hybrid approach. Usage-Based Pricing Usage-based payment is an AI pricing strategy that charges customers based on how often they use the AI product. That means users are charged per API call, processing time, tokens used, or data analyzed. This approach is popular among AI companies because it aligns costs with value delivery and scales naturally with customer growth. Companies like OpenAI and Anthropic use this approach, making AI accessible to startups while capturing revenue from enterprise-scale usage. Tiered Subscription Pricing Tiered subscription pricing lets AI companies serve different customer segments with a single product. The companies offer multiple tiers (often, Basic, Professional, and Enterprise). Each tier includes specific feature sets, usage limits, or service levels. HubSpot is an example of an AI service that offers tier-based pricing. Starter, Pro, and Enterprise all offer different AI-powered features for a set price. Users are not charged based on how many times they use an AI feature. Tiered subscription pricing provides predictable revenue and helps customers understand exactly what they're getting at each price point. Pro tip: Setting up tiered pricing structures is straightforward in HubSpot Sales Hub, and Content Hub's drag-and-drop website builder makes it simple to create clear, professional pricing pages that communicate tier differences effectively. Freemium Models Providing free access to basic AI capabilities attracts users and demonstrates value before asking for payment.

We look at how these readily available tools can quickly enhance pricing decisions, enable new capabilities and improve competitiveness. Sign up for our newsletter AI is moving faster than traditional pricing models can keep up. \"These readily available strategic pricing technologies can be used in any industry, with immediate results.\" Manuel Schieler Partner Frankfurt Office, Central Europe Over the past few years, data-driven pricing models have helped transform pricing strategies in several industries, most notably retail. Machine learning algorithms analyze vast amounts of data in real-time to optimize pricing decisions and maximize returns. However, these tools rely on high frequency, structured data, limiting their use to certain industries.The dawn of generative AI -powered pricing changes all this – and opens up a world of new opportunities. Novel GenAI pricing methods that leverage large language models (LLMs) not only enhance traditional data-driven models. They also enable next-level AI capabilities such as sentiment-driven pricing (where customer perceptions are used to influence pricing decisions), automated analysis and drafting of pricing contracts and agentic AI systems (where AI agents automate multistep processes). And because they can draw on unstructured as well as structured data sources, these readily available strategic pricing technologies can be used in any industry, with immediate results. This makes them a highly effective profit lever.In this article we look at the capabilities, use cases and benefits of GenAI-powered pricing methods, including outlining two examples and how Roland Berger can assist with their implementation. A strategic pricing transformationGlobal trends in pricing in recent years have highlighted the need for data-driven pricing strategies . The rise of sustainability premiums, subscription models, inflationary pressures and volatile commodity prices, for example, are forcing companies to adapt to remain competitive. AI and data analytics are enabling this shift, helping to optimize prices, boost profitability and meet demand.GenAI-powered pricing methods build on traditional data-driven price models added value by allowing companies in any industry to comprehensively understand customers, competition, market trends and more. Use cases can be found all along the pricing journey. \"All of Roland Berger’s pricing project options typically deliver short-term payoffs, with high total ROIs.\" Andreas Weinfurter Partner Stuttgart Office, Central Europe How they work: Examples of GenAI-powered pricing methods The technology works by seamlessly combining multiple real-time data sources, both structured (cost data, sales data, customer data, etc.) and unstructured (customer feedback, social media activity, expert opinions, etc.). This facilitates real-time competitor analysis, multi-channel data gathering, nuanced customer sentiment analysis and highly personalized pricing recommendations. There are several applications for GenAI in pricing; below we outline two examples. Pricing-perception analysisRoland Berger offers a custom-made approach that allows clients to use customer perceptions of their prices to influence their pricing decisions. By feeding unstructured customer data - such as customer reviews - to large language models (LLMs), key pricing themes can be identified. This enables data-driven pricing decisions, the development of new pricing algorithms, and even the embedding of automated feedback loops into operational pricing. The impact is immediate – increased revenue, improved customer satisfaction and a stronger market position.Key benefits of pricing-perception analysis: Stay ahead of the curve: Uncover emerging trends or customer needs earlyPerformance insights: Derive the best measures to address negative drivers. For example, which local branches of our business do we need to prioritize/have the greatest potential?Steer customer thinking: Evaluate the effectiveness of marketing campaigns to influence customer perception and purchasing behavior. For example, if real-time feedback shows a promotion is not working, it can immediately be tweaked and the feedback included in the pricing model for the next promotionCustomized offerings: Assess regional variations in customer preferences and tailor promotions or inventory accordingly.

Global conflicts, unforeseen events, and other uncontrollable factors often cause disruptions in the supply chain, making it challenging – and time-consuming – for brands to stay agile and make good decisions. However, the rise of machine learning (or “ML”) technology presents new opportunities for supply chain managers. These new programs are already making it easier for businesses to make accurate predictions and inform their supply chain planning, and will only get more sophisticated over time. In this post, we’ll dive deeper into the use of machine learning in supply chain logistics, explore how machine learning can benefit supply chains, and share tips for how it can improve your supply chain management. What is machine learning in supply chain logistics? Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) technology that uses data and algorithms to identify patterns and make informed decisions. In supply chain logistics, machine learning technology collects large amounts of data from across various supply chain processes. It then analyzes this data to make smart predictions and suggestions for supply chain optimization. Machine learning programs can be used to gather advanced supply chain analytics so you can easily get actionable insights on performance. Machine learning also enables supply chain automation to a significant extent, allowing you to automate things like demand forecasting and route optimization. As such, machine learning is vital for enhancing supply chain efficiency, saving time, and improving your overall performance. The evolution of machine learning in logistics The logistics industry once largely relied on paper-based systems that involved a lot of manual tracking and required implicit, learned knowledge to make effective decisions. When the first enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems were introduced in the late 1980s, they helped streamline and simplify supply chain logistics management. These ERP systems helped to centralize supply chain processes into a single software. However, they weren’t equipped to process vast amounts of data in real time or make decisions that considered all the intricacies of supply chain dynamics. This often led to incomplete insights and inaccurate predictions, which resulted in sub-optimal supply chain decisions. Flash-forward to present day, and businesses can now access technology that’s capable of collecting and analyzing vast amounts of data in real time from across various supply chain processes. The development of advanced machine learning algorithms that perform predictive analytics now help brands make real-time decisions using this data, making it possible for ecommerce businesses to improve supply chain efficiency and oversee their supply chain operations with minimal human oversight. Modern supply chain technology also leverages machine learning to help automate various activities. This includes IoT devices and robotics that leverage machine learning to automate tasks like warehouse monitoring, picking, packing, and inventory tracking. Key benefits of machine learning for supply chains With its ability to analyze massive data sets in real time and speed up decision-making, machine learning can be highly beneficial for supply chains. Let’s break down some of these key machine learning benefits that are applicable to supply chain operations. Predictive accuracy Machine learning algorithms are capable of analyzing huge volumes of historical data as well as current order data to identify demand patterns. You can use this capability to get accurate predictions about future demand. This streamlines your demand planning efforts, enabling you to plan for production and procurement so as to avoid stockouts and overstocking. With better predictive accuracy, you can optimize your supply chain planning to effectively meet customer demand. You’ll be able to plan ahead based on predicted customer demand, transit times, and production lead times. Decision-making With their ability to perform real-time data analysis, ML algorithms help take the guesswork out of major supply chain decisions and facilitate better decision-making. Because machine learning algorithms are capable of constantly learning based on new data, ensuring to provide the most updated and relevant insights, businesses can use them to make data-driven decisions on which suppliers to use, how much stock to order and when, how to arrange and distribute inventory, which picking strategies to use, and more. Machine learning can even inform decisions about optimal delivery routes so businesses can improve delivery management and enhance customer satisfaction. Cost efficiency Machine lea",

    "extractedText": "How Startups Can Use AI in Their Content Strategy Studies reveal that AI adoption has helped businesses increase revenue and improve customer experience by automating tasks and freeing employees to do more meaningful, critical work. Introduction to AI Artificial intelligence (AI) has long been a hot topic. Just last week it was reported that ChatGPT has become the fastest growing user base in history, reaching 100 million monthly users in just two months! Fictional plots in TV, film, and books have infinitely pitted AI against humans. And with the advent of AI tools for output that has traditionally been created by humans, such as art, marketing content, and even (quite controversially) academic writing, the anxiety surrounding AI is quite understandable. However, research on AI technology paints a less grim picture, especially concerning the application of AI to improve business workflows. A recent IBM survey reveals that global AI adoption is growing steadily. Per IBM, 77% of companies are currently exploring AI to some extent, with 35% using AI in their businesses and 42% studying how they can incorporate AI into their workflows. Many businesses have found AI useful in addressing labor gaps by automating repetitive tasks, allowing finite human resources to focus on more intensive pursuits that require high-level critical thinking. Research also shows that AI contributes to a marked increase in revenue. McKinsey reveals that when supplemented with AI adoption, the following business functions correspond to the highest increases in revenue: AI sales tools have proven to be effective in increasing conversion rates and improving customer experiences, especially for online-based businesses. As such, startups venturing into digital content or eCommerce should leverage AI tools to supplement their existing content strategies and automate a wide range of tasks. A brief history of AI in marketing and related fields There’s no doubt about the value of AI in many areas of business, especially in marketing. With such high demand for agile, high-quality content, more and more teams are leveraging the power of AI to fill content gaps, create prompts, and even carry out technical functions such as keyword research and analytics. Google’s continual refinement of its search algorithm has forced many businesses to whip their websites into shape by creating grammatically correct, informative, and engaging content. Back in 1998, Amazon spearheaded the use of AI based on research by Columbia University computational linguist Jussi Karlgren. Amazon used it to develop collaborative filtering, a function that displayed product recommendations based on collected data. Today, the same technology gives us film and TV show suggestions on Netflix and music recommendations on Spotify. AI cross-references consumer data and browsing history with user profile information and demographics to tailor recommendations based on one’s likes and dislikes. In 2013, AI content creation was first used to generate sports articles that could be published almost in real-time. Yahoo! used Automated Insights’ Wordsmith platform to write personal reports, match recaps, and match previews based on fantasy football data. The platform used natural language generation (NLG) to personalize content for each user. Particular care was given to ensure that the AI captured Yahoo’s brand voice and tone. “The tone of the narratives for Yahoo were intentionally snarky and sarcastic, so there was a process to making sure the jokes, language, and stats about each week’s matchup (or the draft reports at the beginning of the season) that are highlighted were what Yahoo was looking for,” Automated Insights spokesperson Laura Pressman shared. Programmatic ad buying boomed in 2014. With AI, digital ads could be bought and sold based on defined campaign goals and a set budget, as AI made decisions and recommendations based on collected data. In 2015, Google’s AI algorithm RankBrain revolutionized the way people consume and create content by considering user intent when returning search results. Take the query “shepherd’s pie” as an example. The search engine would return results for recipes and tutorial videos based on the understanding that the person is likely looking for information on how to prepare it. As such, historical and literary references about shepherd’s pie would be farther down the roster of search engine results pages (SERPs). In 2016, AI progressed to listening and verbally responding, and virtual assistant devices became valuable additions to modern homes. Since then, more mainstream uses for AI content generation have emerged, with apps like Slack, WhatsApp, and Messenger leveraging AI to answer basic customer support questions via chatbots. This feature provides better customer service, lead generation, and user experience. How startups can use AI for content + tools you can use What does using AI in one’s content strategy mean?

The enthusiasm is still there, but organizations are realizing that scaling AI is far more complicated than launching a pilot. Our latest research — drawing from a global survey of over 1,600 AI leaders and independent analysis of 1,100 company deployments — shows both the progress and the widening execution gap. The state of AI: hype meets reality On paper, adoption looks strong. More than seven in ten organizations have introduced generative AI into their operations. Yet when you look closer, only 6% have fully implemented agentic AI—the next frontier in intelligent automation. Companies tend to fall into four categories. Some are Achievers (about a third of the market), balancing foundational and advanced capabilities with relative ease. Others are Builders, solid on the basics but still expanding. Climbers have experimented with advanced use cases but lack core operational underpinnings. And then there are the Spectators, a sizable 41%, with little to show for their AI ambitions. Industry differences are just as telling. B2C companies are leading with 41% in the Achiever camp, while B2B trails at 31%. Healthcare organizations report the strongest benefits realized from AI investments, while the tech sector unsurprisingly leads in advanced adoption. The AI anxiety spike Adoption hasn’t quieted concerns—if anything, it has amplified them. In 2025, a staggering 83% of AI leaders say they feel major or extreme concern about generative AI. That’s an eightfold increase in just two years. The worries cover familiar ground but with far greater intensity: implementation costs that balloon faster than expected, growing questions around data security, frustration over unreliable outputs, and a lack of transparency in decision-making. Even job displacement, once a background fear, is now front of mind for more than a quarter of respondents. AI is no longer a shiny experiment—it’s a risk management challenge. Budgets: from hype to strategy The spending picture reflects this shift in mindset. Back in 2023, nearly every company said they planned to increase AI budgets. By 2024, that number had nearly halved. This year, spending has stabilized at around 62% planning increases. Healthcare and B2B organizations are now the most aggressive investors, with nearly seven in ten increasing budgets. Financial services is following closely. Across the board, the era of blank-check pilots is over; companies are channeling investment into targeted projects with clear ROI. What’s really being deployed Despite the hype, most of the real progress has been made in foundational capabilities. In e-commerce especially, companies have focused on relevancy ranking, dynamic faceting, and showing product availability—features that directly support conversion. But gaps remain: fewer than four in ten companies support multiple languages, a glaring weakness in global markets. Advanced capabilities, by contrast, are still finding their footing. Hybrid and vector search have gained meaningful traction, but tools like conversational commerce and AI chatbots remain rare, especially in B2B. Why the basics still matter most The data makes one point very clear: without strong foundations, advanced AI simply doesn’t deliver. Companies that put the essentials in place first—things like search relevancy and multilingual support—see far greater conversion lifts than those skipping ahead to trendier technologies. Even the most advanced adopters report diminishing returns when core systems are weak. The lesson is simple: get the basics right, and everything else compounds. Sector snapshots Progress varies dramatically by industry. Retailers and mass merchants have nearly universal adoption of foundational capabilities, but only a fraction have ventured into agentic AI. Automotive companies show a similar pattern, with solid coverage of the basics but little agentic experimentation. Tech firms are further ahead, with almost all foundational boxes checked and nearly a third already deploying agentic solutions. Models in play When it comes to model strategy, the market is split. About half of companies rely solely on commercial models like GPT-4 or Claude. A growing 30% mix commercial and open source, while one in five have gone fully open source. Interestingly, most organizations stick to a single model, signaling that despite all the talk of model diversity, simplicity still rules. The reality of agentic AI Few areas demonstrate the hype-versus-reality divide more starkly than agentic AI. Despite its buzz, only 2% of companies h",

Our AI & Machine Learning, Infrastructure 2021 survey includes direct input from 700 AI decision-makers across the US and UK. Diving into this insight reveals many trends and developments in the market, including an ever-increasing adoption rate, a shift toward both the cloud and the edge, and several hurdles that need to be overcome to get AI projects from concept into production. As ever, all these factors vary by industry and, to a certain extent, by country. This report highlights some key findings ahead of our full Advisory Report. Although much of the data that fuels machine learning comes from edge devices of various types, our data shows that ML is increasingly being done in the cloud, and attention is shifting toward tools that complement that scenario. AI infrastructure is seen as something distinct from overall IT infrastructure (be it cloud, on-premises or hybrid), and budgets are set differently and are expected to grow, having been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Production pipelines will become more efficient with time, but right now the disconnect between IT and business users may be slowing things down, as the latter have a harder time getting approval to start projects and play a smaller role in spending and approval decisions. Organizations are becoming more aware of ESG concerns regarding AI and ML, including whether AI is being used for immoral or unethical purposes, the environmental impact of AI, and government regulation of the sector – the last of which is higher in the US than the UK. Key takeaways from the survey Adoption demographics are gradually shifting from planning and proof-of-concept (POC) stages toward production. In 2020’s AI & Machine Learning, Infrastructure survey, 37% of adopters had AI in production, compared with 42% this year. This suggests the market is maturing. AI infrastructure is planned differently than other IT infrastructure. Two-thirds (66%) of organizations say they have an AI infrastructure purchasing strategy that is separate from the rest of their infrastructure purchasing plans. This percentage is even higher for those that plan their AI infrastructure in advance (75%) versus those that scale on demand (56%). AI infrastructure is different from regular infrastructure in many ways, and therefore requires different kinds of planning and resource allocation. Public cloud dominates AI workload venues. Last year’s trend toward public cloud has only been further solidified in this year’s survey. For respondents currently using AI/ML, public cloud is the most popular primary venue for storage (51%), training (39%) and inference (37%). Along with the cloud, containers are growing in popularity. Sixty-eight percent (68%) of organizations are using containerized environments for ML production, compared with 55% last year. However, container usage among our respondent base remains significantly more popular in the US than the UK. Demand is rising quickly – and spending with it. On average over the past 12 months, enterprises have spent about $1.5m on AI/ML infrastructure. When asked about future demand and spending, the large majority of enterprises (76%) anticipate demands on their infrastructure increasing over the next two years, so it comes as no surprise that, over the next 12 months, 82% of enterprises plan to increase their spending as well. Targets for that spending are led by accelerators (e.g., GPUs, TPUs), whether in the cloud or on-premises. COVID-19 has played a role in accelerating this spending increase. Sixty-four percent (64%) of organizations have increased AI infrastructure spending in response to COVID-19. Spending on AI has and will increase regardless, as demand was rising before the pandemic; however, it has served as a catalyst for both spending and adoption. The average organization takes three months to develop and deploy an ML model from conception to production. Our data suggests that IT-led projects gain approval significantly faster (nine",

Learn more.This voice experience is generated by AI. Learn more.Enterprise AI Adoption Is Rising, But The Conviction Is Still MissinggettyA dichotomy is forming between the personal and the professional when it comes to AI adoption. While generative AI and LLM-based technology options are being increasingly adopted by individuals for personal use, the same cannot be said for large enterprises. Trending terms such as “AI transformation”, |operating-model redesign”, and “enterprise readiness” dominate today’s technology dialogue, yet the reality of adoption and evolution on the ground is more measured. As I look across the marketplace, I see CIOs and CTOs preparing seriously for AI; but unfortunately, most enterprises still lack the conviction to make the large, structural investments required to unlock AI at scale. What specific preparations need to be made before this adoption can begin to mirror personal usage increase, then? And what is behind this hesitancy? Personal AI Adoption Is Surging, but Enterprises Are Moving Cautiously On the consumer side, AI is rocketing ahead. In our own firm, personal adoption is above 95 percent. Educated professionals commonly have multiple Large Language Models on their phones, using them for everything from productive work to quick research. This reflects a deep and wide B2C adoption pattern, similar to what I described in earlier blog analyses of generative AI’s ease of integration and current pricing dynamics. Yet this enthusiasm has not translated into enterprise-scale change. Most large companies have run numerous pilots. Employees use the tools, often enthusiastically, but the ROI remains incremental. For AI to unlock transformational value, enterprises must rethink core operating models, overhaul foundational technology, and redesign critical workflows. Those commitments are substantial, and we simply have not seen firms make them. MORE FOR YOUCIOs Are Locking Down on Preparation, Specifically on Governance, Security, and Vendor Simplification Although enterprises are not yet investing at scale, CIOs and CTOs are far from idle. Across industries, I see three clear patterns of preparation: 1. Building governance and security frameworks Leaders recognize that broad deployment requires rigorous guardrails. This stage mirrors the “last mile” challenges I have written about before, where compliance, security, and organizational alignment become the true bottlenecks to adoption. 2. Developing internal expertise. Companies are building AI fluency through training, small centers of excellence, and targeted hiring. Many are still determining how domain knowledge, functional insight, and prompt engineering will come together in their organizations. 3. Simplifying vendor portfolios. This is perhaps the most significant shift. During the Covid years, shortages of technology talent drove organizations to add vendors rapidly, creating an explosion in supplier portfolios. Today, I see broad, strategic efforts to consolidate these vendors. The motivation is partly cost, but more importantly, enterprises want a simpler, more manageable ecosystem to support AI-driven reinvention. Interestingly, this consolidation is changing market share dynamics. Historically, large low-cost providers were the disproportionate winners. Companies hesitated to shift work to new partners because of risk, and incumbents could defend their footprint. Now the pattern is different: firms are prioritizing capability over scale. Providers positioned around advanced operating models and AI transformation are gaining share, while specialist firms with deep expertise increasingly win work over traditional incumbents. These trends echo the broader shifts we have seen in how Global In-House Centers (GICs) and service providers compete on capability and integration rather than pure labor arbitrage. Why Enterprises Are Still Hesitant to Invest at Scale If preparation is happening everywhere, why is transformation not following? The answer lies in conviction. Companies understand that real value requires deep operating-model change, yet they have not aligned on what that future looks like. Technology teams often look to vendors to deliver innovation, while business lines expect the CIO to bring them fully formed solutions. Meanwhile, vendors themselves are racing to position their AI offerings, but their incentives do not always align with what enterprises truly need. This creates a strategic hesitation: firms want the benefits of AI but are unsure how much to rely on vendors versus internal capabilities, or how to sequence foundational investments that will not",

Enterprise AI now appears to be entering this phase.Today, we’re excited to introduce the state of enterprise AI report⁠(opens in a new window). For the first time, we’re sharing a comprehensive look at how enterprises are adopting AI, what workers say they’re gaining, and how organizational leaders are turning experimentation into measurable productivity and new capabilities.This analysis draws on two novel sources of data:Real-world usage data from enterprise customers of OpenAI.An OpenAI survey of 9,000 workers across almost 100 enterprises documenting patterns of AI adoption.All data points were deidentified and aggregated to preserve privacy.Adoption is accelerating and deepeningThe picture that emerges is clear: enterprise AI adoption is accelerating not just in breadth, but in depth. It is reshaping how people work, how teams collaborate, and how organizations build and deliver products.Over the past year weekly messages in ChatGPT Enterprise increased roughly 8×, and the average worker is sending 30% more messages.Usage of structured workflows such as Projects and Custom GPTs has increased 19× year-to-date, showing a shift from casual querying to integrated, repeatable processes.Average reasoning token consumption per organization has increased by approximately 320× in the past 12 months, suggesting that more intelligent models are being systematically integrated into expanding products and services.People aren’t just using AI more often. They are using it for increasingly sophisticated tasks. Enterprises are expanding both the extensive margin—more workers adopting AI—and the intensive margin—existing users going deeper.Growth is rapid across industries and geographiesAI is gaining traction across every sector, but we’re seeing especially strong momentum in:Technology, healthcare, and manufacturing, which are the fastest growing sectors.Professional services, finance, and technology, which operate at the largest scale.Globally, the fastest‑growing business customer bases include Australia, Brazil, the Netherlands, and France, each exceeding 140% year‑over‑year growth.International API customer growth has exceeded 70% over the last six months, with Japan having the largest number of corporate API customers outside of the U.S.Workers report measurable value from using AIAcross surveyed enterprises, 75% of workers report that using AI at work has improved either the speed or quality of their output. Workers report saving 40-60 minutes per day, with heavy users reporting more than 10 hours per week. Workers report AI is contributing to value across departments:87% of IT workers report faster IT issue resolution.85% of marketing and product users report faster campaign execution.75% of HR professionals report improved employee engagement.73% of engineers report faster code delivery.Crucially, AI is not just helping people do the same work faster—it is enabling people to do new kinds of work.Coding-related messages increased 36% for workers outside of technical functions.75% of users report being able to complete new tasks they previously could not perform.AI reduces the gap between intent and execution. Individuals can translate ideas into concrete outputs, regardless of their specialization or technical expertise.Frontier users and organizations are pulling aheadOur data shows a widening gap between “frontier” workers and firms, and the median.Frontier workers (95th percentile) send 6× more messages than the median employee and engage more intensively across advanced capabilities.Frontier firms send 2× more messages per seat and show deeper integration of AI across teams.These patterns are particularly meaningful given the finding that time savings increase as users consume more intelligence and engage across more distinct tasks.The AI landscape is evolving rapidly; OpenAI releases a new feature or capability roughly every three days. The primary constraints for organizations are no longer model performance or tooling, but rather organizational readiness and implementation.Looking ahead: AI reshaping the modern enterpriseThe state of enterprise AI report⁠(opens in a new window) is designed to do more than describe how AI adoption is changing, it’s meant to help organizations plan how to deploy more effectively.

AI Boom vs. Bubble For all the fears of over-investment, AI is spreading across enterprises at a pace with no precedent in modern software history. For nearly three years, AI enjoyed unwavering confidence and record capital flows. The surge crowned Nvidia the world’s most valuable company.1 Foundation models announced close to $1 trillion in AI infrastructure commitments. Venture funding surged back toward all-time highs, with nearly half of it concentrated in just a handful of frontier AI labs. Then the euphoria peaked. An MIT study2 claiming that 95% of generative AI initiatives fail rattled markets over the summer, exposing how quickly sentiment could shift beneath the weight of AI’s massive capex spend. The whispers of a bubble became a din. The concerns aren’t unfounded given the magnitude of the numbers being thrown around. But the demand side tells a different story: Our latest market data shows broad adoption, real revenue, and productivity gains at scale, signaling a boom versus a bubble. Enterprise AI has surged from $1.7B to $37B since 2023, now capturing 6% of the global SaaS market and growing faster than any software category in history. For Menlo’s third annual State of Generative AI in the Enterprise report, we surveyed ~500 U.S. enterprise decision-makers and combined their insights with a bottoms-up model of the generative AI market spanning model APIs, infrastructure, and applications. Since 2023, our team has tracked AI’s evolution from early experiments to broad enterprise deployment, giving us a multi-year view of the speed and scale of this transformation. Follow the Money: Where Do Enterprise Dollars Flow? Our data indicates companies spent $37 billion on generative AI in 2025,3 up from $11.5 billion4 in 2024, a 3.2x year-over-year increase. The largest share, $19 billion, went to the user-facing products and software that leverage underlying AI models, aka the application layer. This represents more than 6% of the entire software market, all achieved within three years of ChatGPT’s launch. Growth extends far beyond a handful of AI chat apps, touching every domain in the economy. By our count, there are now at least 10 products generating over $1 billion in ARR and 50 products generating over $100 million in ARR, led by the model APIs powering applications (Anthropic*, OpenAI, Google), but increasingly distributed across departmental solutions in coding, sales, customer support, HR, and verticals from healthcare and legal to the creator economy. In 2025, more than half of enterprise AI spend went to AI applications, indicating that modern enterprises are prioritizing immediate productivity gains vs. long-term infrastructure bets. How AI Enters the Enterprise: The Path to Production After three years, enterprise AI’s path to production has taken shape. Early adopters had no playbook. Now, distinct patterns have emerged that break from traditional SaaS. Enterprises prefer buying over building, showing stronger purchase intent, and adopting AI through product-led growth at a scale rarely seen in enterprise software. Enterprises Are Buying More Than Building For a while, the prevailing wisdom was that enterprises would build most AI solutions themselves. Bloomberg trained BloombergGPT for finance in 2022, Walmart built Wallaby for retail in 2024. Teams were confident that, with the right data, domain expertise, and scaffolding, they could handle everything in-house. In 2024, that confidence still showed in the data: 47% of AI solutions were built internally, 53% purchased.5 Today, 76% of AI use cases are purchased rather than built internally. Despite continued strong investments in internal builds, ready-made AI solutions are reaching production more quickly and demonstrating immediate value while enterprise tech stacks continue to mature. Last year, enterprises were split on building vs. buying. Today, enterprises have more ready-made AI solutions in production as their internal builds mature. AI Buyers Convert at Higher Rates Enterprise buyers approach AI with notably high intent. We found that, once an organization commits to exploring an AI solution, deals convert at nearly twice the rate of traditional software: 47% of AI deals go to production, compared to 25% for traditional SaaS. That elevated conversion reflects strong buyer commitment and clear immediate value. Our survey data reveals that most organizations surface a long list of potential AI use cases—often 10 or more—but focus their adoption on near-term productivity gains or cost savings. While enterprises identify slightly more internal-facing use cases (59%) than customer-facing ones (41%), both categories move through the pipeline at nearly identical rates, suggesting that operational AI investments deli",

Andrea Hill is a multi-industry CEO covering business & technology.Follow AuthorOct 03, 2025, 06:20pm EDTOct 19, 2025, 04:47pm EDTThe focus is now shifting to AI and competitive advantage, as companies rethink what will set them apart in the years ahead.Even without significant new advances in the technology, AI will change the nature of competitive advantage.gettyA New Era of CompetitionBusiness history is marked by shifts in how companies create advantage. In the industrial age, efficiency ruled, as Henry Ford transformed car manufacturing by lowering costs through assembly lines. In the late 20th century, Walmart became a giant by driving relentless supply chain efficiency, while McDonald’s standardized processes to deliver speed and consistency worldwide. The digital era added a new edge: speed and customer access. Amazon, for example, can introduce new features dozens of times a day, while Netflix can spot changes in viewer preferences and launch new shows before its rivals even notice the trend.We now stand on the edge of another transformation. As McKinsey recently noted in its paper “The Agentic Organization: Contours of the Next Paradigm for the AI Era” (Sept. 2025), artificial intelligence is shifting the source of competitive advantage once again. This is not about clever tools or chatbots, but rather, about rethinking the fundamentals of how value is created.The companies that understand this shift and act on it will win market share. Those that wait risk being left behind.From Efficiency to IntelligenceThe introduction of AI into core business operations does more than speed things up. It changes the math of business itself. For most of history, the cost of serving more customers rose in step with growth. To sell more cars, Ford had to build more factories. To expand retail, Walmart had to hire more people and open more stores. Digital businesses gained efficiency in how they reached customers and processed transactions, removing some of the friction of physical operations, but costs still rose as they scaled.MORE FOR YOUAI-first workflows would shift that equation. Once a process is redesigned to run primarily through intelligent systems, the cost of serving one more customer becomes minimal. McKinsey researchers describe this effect as driving “marginal costs toward the cost of compute.” In plain English, this means that whether you handle one customer or one million, the extra cost is almost negligible.Consider customer service. In the past, doubling call volume meant doubling staff. With AI systems handling the bulk of routine questions, a company can scale to millions of interactions while reserving its people for only the most complex cases. Human attention becomes more valuable, because it is spent on higher-order problems, not on volume.This is why AI doesn’t just improve efficiency. It rewrites the rules of how companies grow.This is a fundamental break from the past. For most of history, growth and cost were tied together. To serve more customers, you needed more employees, more equipment, or more stores. In the AI era, the relationship between growth and cost loosens. This changes how growth works, allowing companies to get bigger without the traditional jump in costs.Data Becomes the Raw Material of AdvantageIf AI is the engine, data is the fuel. But not all data is equal. Public data (the information available to anyone) is now accessible through shared AI systems. That means it offers no real competitive edge to anyone.What matters is the data only your company can capture: the customer histories, usage patterns, performance records, and sensor readings that reflect how your products and services work in the real world. McKinsey describes this as building a “walled garden” of proprietary data that competitors cannot easily replicate.Consider a manufacturer that tracks performance across thousands of machines in its plants. By analyzing that data, it can predict failures, reduce downtime, and design better products faster than competitors. Or picture a bank that uses decades of transaction data to create financial services tailored not just to a demographic group, but to individual households. These are insights no competitor can simply copy.Unfortunately, many companies are still struggling with more than messy data. They are running on outdated systems that can’t talk to each other, patching gaps with spreadsheets, and piling on shadow software (often not integrated) just to keep things moving. Critical platforms like ERP systems are often long past their prime, but leaders hesitate to upgrade because the work will be expensive and overwhelming. The choice, however, is stark: do the hard work of modernization now, or lose the chance to compete while waiting a little longer. Companies that invest in fixing these foundat",

Evidenced by Microsoft's State of AI Infrastructure report, 95% of businesses planning to increase their AI usage over the next two years, simply adopting AI is no longer enough—success lies in how strategically you implement and leverage it to transform your business operations and market position. The Strategic Imperative of AI When 75% of business leaders personally view AI as critical to their success, we're witnessing more than a technological shift—we're seeing a fundamental transformation in how businesses compete and win. This isn't about keeping up with trends; it's about reimagining how we create and capture value in the digital age. Beyond Automation The most successful organizations understand that AI's true power lies not in automating existing processes, but in fundamentally transforming how they operate, serve customers, and compete in the marketplace. This transformation manifests across three critical dimensions: Market Intelligence and Decision Making Today's competitive advantage often comes down to speed and quality of decision-making. AI transforms raw data into actionable insights, enabling organizations to spot market trends, identify opportunities, and respond to competitive threats faster than ever before. This isn't just about having more data—it's about having better insights, faster. Customer Experience Revolution The ability to deliver personalized, proactive customer experiences at scale has become a key differentiator. Advanced AI systems now enable organizations to predict customer needs, personalize interactions, and resolve issues before they escalate. This level of service was impossible just a few years ago, but it's quickly becoming the new standard. Operational Excellence While 62% of organizations have implemented document-process automation, true leaders are pushing beyond basic automation to achieve what we call \"intelligent operations\"—systems that not only execute tasks but learn, adapt, and improve over time. Scaling Business with AI Perhaps the most significant competitive advantage AI offers is its ability to accelerate innovation. Organizations leveraging AI effectively can: Test new ideas faster and more cost-effectively Identify untapped market opportunities Develop products and services that better meet customer needs Scale successful initiatives more rapidly Building Strategic AI Capabilities The path to competitive advantage through AI isn't about implementing individual technologies—it's about building organizational capabilities that enable continuous innovation and adaptation. This requires a strategic approach that addresses: Leadership and Vision Success starts with leadership that understands both the potential and limitations of AI. Leaders must articulate a clear vision for how AI will create value for the organization and its stakeholders. Organizational Readiness Building a strong foundation is crucial. This means investing in: The right infrastructure Data quality and governance Talent development Change management Measuring Strategic Impact Understanding AI's contribution to competitive advantage requires new metrics that go beyond traditional ROI calculations. Leading organizations are measuring: Speed to market for new initiatives Customer engagement and satisfaction Operational efficiency gains Innovation pipeline velocity Market responsiveness In the race for competitive advantage, security cannot be an afterthought. Organizations that build security and privacy into their AI strategy from the ground up not only protect themselves but also gain customer trust—an increasingly valuable competitive differentiator. Future-Proofing Your Strategy The most successful organizations approach AI not as a one-time implementation but as a continuous journey of learning and adaptation. This means: Staying ahead of technological developments Continuously reassessing and adjusting strategy Building flexible, scalable systems Fostering a culture of innovation and experimentation Organizations that succeed are those that: Empower employees with AI tools Foster a culture of continuous learning Maintain focus on relationships and creativity Strategic Recommendations To leverage AI for competitive advantage: Start with a clear vision of how AI will create value for your organization Build strong foundations in data, infrastructure, and talent Focus on areas where AI can create unique differentiation Maintain balance between innovation and security Invest in continuous learning and adaptation In an era where AI is becoming ubiquitous, competitive advantage will come not from having AI, but from using it more strategically and effectively than others. Organizations that approach AI as a transformative force, align it with their business strategy, and build the capabilities to leverage it effective",

By the end of this post, you’ll have a clear understanding of the opportunities and challenges facing the jewelry industry and be equipped with the knowledge to make informed decisions about your business strategy. The jewelry industry is on the cusp of a revolution, driven by technological advancements, shifting consumer behaviors, and evolving business strategies. As we delve into the top 5 CRM jewelry trends of 2025, it’s essential to understand the context in which these trends are emerging. The digital transformation of luxury retail has been accelerating, with online sales projected to continue growing. In this landscape, Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems are no longer a nice-to-have, but a must-have for jewelry businesses aiming to thrive. In this section, we’ll explore the evolving landscape of jewelry CRM, discussing why it’s critical for businesses in 2025 and setting the stage for the top trends that will shape the industry’s future. The Digital Transformation of Luxury Retail The jewelry industry has undergone a significant transformation in recent years, shifting from traditional brick-and-mortar stores to omnichannel experiences. According to a report by McKinsey, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated digital adoption in luxury retail, with online sales increasing by 50% in 2020 alone. This trend is expected to continue, with 70% of luxury consumers now using online channels to research and purchase luxury goods. Post-pandemic, customer expectations have changed drastically, with consumers demanding seamless online-offline integration in jewelry retail. A study by Bain & Company found that 60% of luxury consumers expect a personalized experience across all touchpoints, including online, social media, and in-store. To meet these expectations, jewelry retailers must invest in digital technologies, such as e-commerce platforms, social media, and data analytics tools, to create a cohesive and engaging customer experience. Digital adoption rates in luxury retail have increased by 30% since 2020, with online sales accounting for 20% of total sales in the jewelry industry. 80% of luxury consumers use social media to discover new brands and products, highlighting the importance of social media marketing in jewelry retail. A seamless online-offline integration is crucial, with 70% of consumers expecting a consistent experience across all channels, including online, mobile, and in-store. By embracing digital transformation and investing in technologies that enable seamless online-offline integration, jewelry retailers can meet the evolving expectations of their customers, drive sales, and stay competitive in a rapidly changing market. We here at SuperAGI have seen this trend firsthand, and are committed to helping jewelry retailers thrive in this new landscape. Why CRM is Critical for Jewelry Businesses in 2025 The jewelry retail industry presents a unique set of challenges, including high-value purchases, emotional significance, and long purchase cycles. These factors make it crucial for jewelry businesses to invest in sophisticated CRM systems that can help them build strong relationships with customers and drive long-term growth. According to a study by Bain & Company, customer retention rates in the jewelry sector are significantly lower than in other retail segments, with an average retention rate of 20-30% compared to 50-60% in other industries. However, when jewelry businesses are able to retain customers, the payoff can be substantial. A study by McKinsey & Company found that the lifetime value of a customer in the jewelry sector can be up to 5 times higher than in other retail segments. This highlights the importance of implementing effective CRM strategies to nurture customer relationships and encourage repeat business. To achieve this, jewelry businesses can leverage CRM systems to gain a deeper understanding of their customers’ preferences, behaviors, and purchase histories. By analyzing this data, businesses can create personalized marketing campaigns, offer tailored recommendations, and provide exceptional customer service. Some key statisti",

From personalized recommendations to smart inventory forecasting, AI gives jewelry retailers a competitive edge—especially those working in fast-moving categories like stainless steel, fashion, and trend-driven pieces. Whether you operate a brick-and-mortar store or sell online, leveraging AI tools can dramatically increase your sales in 2025 and beyond. Let’s explore the most powerful AI strategies for retail jewelry brands and how to implement them. AI-Powered Virtual Try-On & Visual Tools Augmented reality and AI are changing the way customers shop for jewelry—especially online. By offering virtual try-on features, brands can build shopper confidence, increase engagement, and reduce returns. How Virtual Try-On Increases Jewelry Sales AI and AR-powered tools allow shoppers to \"try on\" rings, earrings, necklaces, and bracelets using just their smartphone or laptop camera. These tools use computer vision to detect facial features and hand shapes, rendering realistic previews of how pieces will look when worn. Not only do virtual try-ons reduce return rates, they also enhance conversion by making the experience more interactive. This is especially effective for trend-driven pieces like oversized hoops or statement necklaces—where visual appeal drives the purchase decision. Enhancing Product Visualization with AI Beyond virtual try-on, AI can generate 3D product visualizations that allow customers to rotate and zoom in on jewelry pieces. These features are crucial for fashion jewelry and stainless steel accessories where texture, shine, and styling are key selling points. Chatbots & AI-Powered Customer Support Exceptional customer service is a major driver of retail sales—and AI can help you deliver it at scale. Smart chatbots and AI-driven help desks can answer customer questions in real time, no matter the hour. 24/7 AI Chatbots for Retail Jewelry Stores AI chatbots are now sophisticated enough to handle inquiries about product details, shipping, sizing, and even style recommendations. This technology is especially useful for online wholesale jewelry brands where high product volume and frequent customer inquiries can strain human support teams. AI bots can help customers choose the right chain length, identify matching earrings, or resolve pre-sale concerns instantly—leading to more conversions with less friction. Sentiment Analysis & Post-Purchase Support AI can also analyze reviews, returns, and chat transcripts to detect patterns and common customer issues. Sentiment analysis allows brands to proactively fix problems, respond to negative experiences, and improve satisfaction—all of which help drive long-term sales. Predictive Analytics & Inventory Optimization Retail jewelry brands—especially wholesalers—need to manage stock levels carefully. AI predictive analytics help forecast demand, reduce overstock, and ensure top-selling items are always available. Forecasting Trends Before They Happen AI tools analyze customer behavior, historical sales, seasonal shifts, and even fashion trend data to anticipate future demand. For example, if AI detects growing interest in layered stainless steel necklaces or zodiac-themed charm bracelets, your team can increase orders and marketing efforts in advance. This demand forecasting reduces inventory waste and helps you stay ahead of seasonal trends—critical for success in fast-moving categories like fashion jewelry. Smarter Merchandising with AI Insights Clienteling tools powered by AI help retailers connect with past buyers by recommending products they're likely to purchase next. These tools allow in-store associates and e-commerce platforms to suggest products based on purchase history, preferences, and browsing behavior—leading to more personalized upsells and stronger customer loyalty. Personalized Marketing & Recommendation Engines Consumers expect personalization—and AI makes it scalable. From product recommendations to targeted email campaigns, AI lets you market the right product to the right customer at the right time. AI Product Recommendations That Drive Sales Recommendation engines analyze customer data—such as product views, abandoned carts, and wishlist activity—to suggest jewelry pieces that align with each shopper’s tastes. These tools can dynamically update homepage displays, shopping carts, or follow-up emails to boost conversion rates. A shopper who browses stainless steel rings in gold tones might be shown coordinating earrings or layered bracelets that complete the look. These relevant suggestions increase average order value and reduce bounce rates. AI Marketing in Action: A Real Retail Example Brands like Kendra Scott use AI “copilot” tools ",

As Henry Ford famously said, “They can have any color they want…as long as it’s black!” The market was driven by costs, and why not? Businesses had very little idea what customers really wanted. The advertising industry was in its infancy – the concept or talking to customers at all was little known. Step forward to today and Henry Ford would be shocked. Not only is customer communication now a two-way street but individualizing products at an affordable price is now a reality for many product lines. The level of change will only accelerate from here. Let’s discuss three areas where the impact is greatest – one you will be very aware of; one you have become recently aware of and one you may not know at all. The Shift to Online Retail Over the past five years, we’ve seen a substantial shift in consumer behavior. In 2020, e-commerce sales surged by 44%—the highest growth rate in over two decades. As of 2023, online retail now accounts for approximately 21% of total retail sales in the U.S. This shift is reshaping the traditional brick-and-mortar experience. Many are investing in their online presence, offering click-and-collect services or enhancing their delivery options to compete with giants like Amazon. The retail landscape is becoming more integrated, with physical and online stores working together to provide seamless experiences. Those who have not started to build a stronger online shopping and social media presence will be left behind. The Rise of AI in Retail AI may seem like a buzzword right now, but it has huge potential to impact how your customers’ shop. From personalized recommendations to chatbots that provide customer support, AI is enhancing the shopping experience in ways you might not even realize. Online retailers like Amazon have long used the “recommended for you” concept to suggest additional products at checkout but this will only grow further and become more tailored as AI is added to the mix. According to recent research, around 70% of consumers expect personalized experiences when shopping online. Retailers are responding by utilizing AI to analyze vast amounts of data, allowing them to tailor offers and promotions to individual preferences. This personalization will not only improve your customer’s shopping experience but will also boost sales and profits for retailer’s savvy enough to join in. Blockchain: The Future of Transparency While blockchain is often associated with cryptocurrencies, its potential in retail is intriguing. Blockchain is a system of recording transactions and other information across a series of computers, making it easy to trace the chain of activity from source to end use. It has the potential to allow consumers to trace the journey of your product from the manufacturer to your doorstep. Blockchain technology offers a level of transparency that, for consumers, means knowing exactly where your product comes from and ensuring that it’s ethically sourced. According to a study, around 57% of consumers are willing to change their shopping habits to help reduce negative environmental impact. Blockchain can play a significant role here by providing verifiable information about a product’s supply chain. This transparency can build trust and loyalty, essential for retailers looking to thrive in a competitive market.So, what does the future hold? Expect to see even more integration of AI and blockchain in retail. AI will continue to enhance personalization, while blockchain will likely push for greater transparency, accountability and ethical practices. As online retail grows, traditional stores will adapt by creating unique experiences that keep customers coming back. Despite the ‘negative’ trend towards online the future of instore experiences can still be bright if handled correctly. A recent report found that 75% of consumers still prefer to shop in physical stores for certain categories, such as groceries and luxury items. This means that while online shopping is convenient, there’s still a strong desire for the tactile experience that physical stores offer. The future of instore retail will belong to those who can harness this desire. Industry Insight for Retail Jewelers: For retail jewelers, the future of retail means embracing new tools while preserving what makes jewelry unique. Online platforms and AI can help attract new buyers and personalize recommendations, while blockchain builds trust by verifying diamond and gemstone sourcing. Yet, the in-store experience remains essential as customers still seek the expertise and service jewelers provide.

Whether you’re excited about AI or highly skeptical of it, you’ve probably asked yourself, “How will this technology affect my jewelry store?” There’s pressure not to be left behind if you don't implement it. But rest assured: Embracing AI doesn’t mean changing your entire business. You can start by automating simple tasks. In this blog, we’ll highlight practical AI and automation-powered tools you can use at your jewelry store to save time and energy, as well as tips for implementing them in a smooth and non-threatening way for your employees. Let’s get started. AI Features for Jewelry Stores Here’s how automation and AI-powered tools could lighten the load of running your jewelry store. 1. Inventory Demand Forecasting Optimizing your inventory purchasing strategy is an incremental process that often takes years to perfect. The goal is to keep inventory moving steadily — avoiding products that sit on the shelves endlessly or selling out of popular items. To accurately predict how much jewelry you’ll sell, you need to understand your customers’ buying behavior and external factors such as seasonality. Modern point of sale (POS) systems offer reporting tools, and some include AI-generated forecasts that predict how much jewelry you’re likely to sell. These tools use your existing sales data to make predictions — and the more data you have, the more accurate they are. Along with these predictions are automated reorder suggestions. The system generates a suggested order size that aligns with expected sales. Of course, you can then choose to order more or less, taking all factors into account. Related Read: Seasonal Sales Patterns: When Jewelry Stores Actually Make Their Money 2. AI-Assisted Marketing Content AI can also help you write marketing content, including ad copy, website text, and messages to customers. Nick Gurney, general manager for Jewel360, spoke on the value of AI for marketing: “AI tools don’t replace expertise, but they do level you up in areas where you’re not an expert. For instance, when you use AI to build a marketing message for your store about choosing between lab-grown and natural diamonds, you can be the expert on the diamonds, and let AI be the expert at writing marketing copy.” Using AI, you can convey your knowledge of the industry using language that resonates with customers. Many POS systems offer customer relationship management (CRM). This feature lets you keep records of individual customers, including their contact information, purchase history, and any work orders. With AI, you can use this data to send them catered recommendations based on what they’ve purchased in the past. If a customer has previously purchased gold rings and earrings, you can send them an email with other gold jewelry items you stock, including new arrivals you’ve added to your inventory. When your recommendations are specifically chosen for a customer, they’ll be more likely to open and read these communications and to return to the store. 3. Automated Customer Communication Marketing isn’t the only reason you communicate with your customers. You might send them texts or emails with: Receipts Confirmations Customer service information Repair updates While some of these messages may require a personal touch, others are routine and can be automated. If a customer is having a piece of jewelry repaired, you can use your POS system to update them when a status changes or a piece is ready for pickup, or to send an automated response to a customer service inquiry.

AI can touch up photos so each piece of jewelry looks its best. You can take an image of a diamond ring and ask AI to brighten it or increase the resolution. You can also use AI to generate detailed product descriptions based on available data about the item. These product bios showcase a piece of jewelry’s best qualities and educate shoppers on its features. When you use relevant SEO terms, they also help your website show up in search results. 5. Customer Service Chatbots You’ve probably visited a website that had an AI customer service chatbot. While they often can’t answer all of the questions a human can, they can answer simple, common questions about store hours, return policies, and other basic information. Making a chatbot available reduces the number of calls and emails coming into the store, freeing you and your staff to focus on other tasks. Integrating AI at Your Jewelry Store Hopefully, you’re now more familiar with the AI and automation tools available and how they benefit you as a jewelry store owner. But even when you know how AI can help your business, you may still feel some hesitation about integ",

You’ve probably heard it before... \"AI helps with personalization,\" \"AI improves inventory management,\" \"AI this, AI that.\" But let’s be real. If we strip away the buzzwords, is AI really revolutionizing jewelry retail the way it has for other industries? Or are we still scratching the surface while thinking we’ve reached the peak? Most retailers are using AI at a basic level: chatbots, simple recommendation engines, automated pricing. That’s great, but it’s like using a Formula 1 car just to drive to the grocery store. AI has the power to completely transform how jewelry is designed, marketed, sold, and experienced. If you’re not thinking beyond the basics, you’re already behind. Let’s talk about the real game-changers: the innovations that could truly disrupt the jewelry industry. AI-Designed Jewelry That Customers Can Co-Create Jewelry has always been about craftsmanship, artistry, and human touch. But what if AI could enhance that rather than replace it? Imagine a customer walking into your store, describing a ring they have in mind, and an AI-powered tool generating a precise 3D model in real-time. Not just pulling up generic templates, but creating a unique piece based on their words, preferences, and even emotional cues detected through AI. Luxury brands are already experimenting with generative AI in design. Some companies allow customers to tweak existing designs, but the real future lies in customers co-creating with AI. This isn’t about replacing designers; it’s about giving them superpowers, enabling them to experiment with shapes, patterns, and materials in ways never imagined. Think of it as custom design at scale; something that was once exclusive to high-end jewelers is now possible for every retailer. That’s how AI changes the game. Predictive AI That Knows What Your Customers Want Before They Do Every retailer dreams of the perfect inventory: never overstocked, never understocked, and always aligned with what customers want. But most inventory decisions are still based on past sales data. That’s like driving while only looking in the rearview mirror. AI can predict trends before they peak. How? By analyzing everything from customer browsing patterns to social media trends, regional preferences, and even economic factors. AI can tell you: Which designs will be hot six months from now. What styles your specific customer base is gravitating toward. How a global fashion trend will trickle down to your local market. It’s not just about stocking the right products: it’s about being one step ahead of consumer demand. Imagine knowing that emeralds will see a surge in popularity next season before your competitors do. Now that is retail intelligence. AI That Reads Emotions and Sells Jewelry Differently Jewelry is emotional. Every purchase, whether an engagement ring, a gift, or even a self-indulgent buy, is tied to a feeling. So why are we still selling it like any other product? AI-driven sentiment analysis can detect why a customer is buying a piece. Is it excitement? Nostalgia? Love? Guilt? Depending on the emotion, your AI-powered sales assistant (whether in-store or online) can adjust the sales approach. A nervous engagement ring buyer? AI can suggest comforting, confidence-boosting messaging. A self-purchase by a career-driven woman? AI can frame the purchase as a reward for success. A hesitant high-value buyer? AI can subtly nudge with social proof—\"This limited edition piece was just bought by someone in New York.\" This isn’t science fiction. AI is already being used in other industries to read microexpressions and tone of voice. Jewelry retail needs to catch up. AI-Powered \"Try Before You Buy\" That’s Actually Convincing Virtual try-ons have been around, but let’s be honest: most of them are clunky. The lighting is off, the scale isn’t perfect, and they don’t truly replicate the experience of holding a piece in your hand. What if AI could simulate how a piece of jewelry feels on you? Advanced AI combined with AR and haptic technology can recreate the weight, sparkle, and even the way light interacts with gemstones. Imagine a virtual experience where a customer sees how a diamond reacts to different lighting—daylight, candlelight, office light—before they buy.

The findings tracked payments activity over a seven-week period beginning Nov. 1 using a subset of Visa payments network data in the U.S. and cover core retail categories, excluding spending on automotive, gasoline and restaurants. The figures are also not adjusted for inflation.In-store shopping accounted for the bulk of holiday spending, capturing 73% of total retail payment volume during the period, while online purchases made up the remaining 27%. However, e-commerce was the primary driver of growth, with online sales rising 7.8% compared with last year, reflecting continued demand for convenience and early-season promotions.\"The underlying surprise here ... is that consumer spending is holding up reasonably well in light of softer consumer confidence than we had this time last year and a number of headwinds and concerns about inflation,\" Michael Brown, principal U.S. economist at Visa, told CNBC.Brown noted that the 2025 holiday season marked a distinct shift in consumer behavior, citing the growing influence of artificial intelligence in how shoppers find products and compare prices. \"We are seeing consumers use AI in a big way in comparison shopping and then helping to narrow down that perfect gift,\" Brown said. \"This is the first holiday shopping season where roughly half of the consumers in that survey responded that they are going to leverage AI for one of those two tasks.\"Read moreAI tools could drive $263 billion in holiday sales.

Here's why they're spending anywaySupplements in your stocking: Why wellness gifts are gaining steam for the holidays and beyondThe breakdown of spending categories highlights a shift toward personal goods and convenience, and away from home renovation projects.Electronics emerged as the season's top-performing category, with sales climbing 5.8%. Visa attributed this jump to a refresh cycle driven by \"high-performance devices in the AI era.\"Apparel and accessories also posted strong numbers, rising 5.3%. General merchandise stores — retailers that offer a \"one-stop\" experience — saw a 3.7% lift.Conversely, the home improvement sector struggled during the holidays. Spending on building materials and garden equipment fell 1%, suggesting consumers prioritized gift-giving and gadgets over home maintenance as the year closed out. Furniture and home furnishings remained essentially flat, eking out a 0.8% gain.While the headline number is positive for the retail sector, the lack of inflation adjustment means the \"real\" volume growth will likely be more modest depending on the final Consumer Price Index readings for the period. Currently, Brown said, real spending growth adjusted for inflation is still up about 2.2% this season. \"That's not too bad in light of a lot of uncertainty this year,\" Brown said. \"The consumer is uncertain, they're cautious, but they're also smart about how they're spending their money.\"Visa's numbers also point to a disconnect between sentiment and action this season. According to the CNBC All-America Economic Survey released last week, 41% of Americans said they planned to spend less for the holidays this year, 6 points higher than a year ago.The CNBC survey found that the high cost of goods was emerging as a major factor in determining how much shoppers spend and where they spend, suggesting yearslong inflation and the rise in import goods prices from tariffs are being felt at checkout.",

    "extractedText": "Despite macroeconomic concerns, the holidays are still a priority for consumers. Early data from Visa shows that U.S. holiday retail spending rose 4.2% year-over-year, excluding inflation. The report is based on payments activity tracked from early November and excludes automotive, gas, and restaurant spending. While in-store purchases still account for nearly three-quarters of holiday spending, e-commerce emerged as the primary driver of growth. Artificial intelligence also played a role in the online shopping boom. Visa found that roughly half of surveyed consumers said they planned to use AI tools for comparison shopping and to help narrow down gift choices. “It’s good news that holiday sales are up over 4% and e-commerce sales largely drove that by growing almost 8%,” said Don Apgar, Director of Merchant Payments at Javelin Strategy & Research. “Certainly, AI is playing a role in this growth by making it easier to search for products with less-defined input.” “So-called agentic search uses AI to discern meaning and intent from user search requests, rather than just matching on key words,” he said. “Because agentic search can deliver more accurate context-aware results, users are more likely to follow through with purchasing one of the suggested items.” Picking It Up Today It’s important to distinguish between agentic search—where AI agents help users discover products or services—and full-fledged agentic commerce. For example, a recent agentic search partnership between PayPal and AI platform Perplexity allows users to consult an agent and complete purchases within a chat interference, but the final decision remains with the shopper. This trend is prompting many merchants to rethink their strategies, though it doesn’t diminish the importance of the brick-and-mortar experience. “While there’s no question that agentic search is giving e-commerce a boost, what’s notable in all of this is that physical retail still accounted for almost 75% of total retail spending this holiday season, according to Visa’s research,” Apgar said. “While agentic search can only discover results on the web, this underscores the importance of omnichannel alignment for retailers.” “In-store inventory and buying options need to be available for agentic search engines so the consumer still gets meaningful results when they add ‘that I can pick up today’ to the end of their search query,” he said. The Agentic Holidays Despite these dynamic shifts, the retail sector is still far from true agentic commerce, in which AI agents independently handle most or all aspects of a transaction with minimal user involvement. While agentic commerce has yet to gain the same level of adoption as agentic search, Visa expects that to change. The company said it already completed hundreds of AI-driven transactions through trials of its Intelligent Commerce program and anticipates that millions of consumers will rely on AI agents as personal shoppers during next year’s holiday season. 0 SHARES 0 VIEWS Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on LinkedIn Tags: Agentic AIAgentic Commerceagentic searchAIE-commerceHoliday ShoppingHoliday Spending",

    "extractedText": "Login Sign Up Post AI CERTS 4 weeks ago Visa Pushes Agentic AI Commerce Toward Holiday 2026 Reality Industry veterans remember earlier hype cycles. However, the scale of Visa’s network, combined with new security tooling, signals genuine momentum. In contrast to previous pilots, current trials involve more than 100 ecosystem partners spanning processors, cloud providers, and AI platforms. Therefore, observers see a coordinated path from experiment to mainstream deployment. Agentic AI Commerce streamlines secure retail payments in daily life. Visa Milestone Explained Clearly Rubail Birwadker summarized the breakthrough: “AI agents won’t just assist; they will complete your purchases.” Visa Intelligent Commerce (VIC) underpins that vision. Accordingly, the company finished “hundreds” of controlled transactions using agent-bound tokens and fresh transaction identifiers. These data points prove real funds moved safely, meeting stringent Payments oversight. Furthermore, Visa partnered with Akamai, Cloudflare, and leading acquirers to validate each flow. The network now evaluates agent signals alongside behavior analytics before authorizing spending. Consequently, issuing banks gain richer context and can apply tuned risk models. Although pilot volumes remain modest, the approach demonstrates clear Global ambition. Key Numbers Snapshot 47% of U.S. shoppers used AI for at least one shopping task in October 2025. Adobe recorded a 4,700% jump in AI-driven retail traffic during 2025. Akamai counted 25 billion bot requests in two months, a 300% annual surge. Visa analyses about 200 billion transactions yearly across 175 million merchants. These statistics reveal enormous latent demand. Nevertheless, they also underscore mounting attack surfaces. The milestone section highlights early proof while previewing scalability questions. Subsequently, practitioners must examine supporting protocols. Trusted Agent Protocol Details The Trusted Agent Protocol forms the technical backbone. Built on HTTP Message Signatures, it lets merchants distinguish legitimate agents from malicious bots. Additionally, the protocol conveys consumer recognition data and optional payment metadata. Therefore, checkout systems can accept agent traffic without abandoning existing web infrastructure. Visa released open developer resources in October 2025. Meanwhile, Akamai integrated edge behavioral intelligence, enhancing bot filtering and authentication. Consequently, merchants receive a dual signal: cryptographic agent identity plus behavioral assurance. Standards bodies, including IETF and EMVCo, monitor progress to ensure future interoperability. The protocol’s design favors low-code implementation. Moreover, agent-bound tokens tie credentials to one authorized entity, limiting credential reuse. Payments stakeholders praise this approach because it aligns with existing tokenization flows. The strategy addresses fraud concerns while supporting rapid Adoption. Understanding this framework clarifies why partners joined quickly. However, competition among protocols remains fierce, which we explore next. Industry Adoption And Competition Visa is not alone in shaping Agentic AI Commerce. Mastercard launched Agent Pay, Google pushes its AP2 framework, and PayPal tests proprietary flows. Consequently, merchants face a fragmented Standards landscape. Nevertheless, major processors—Stripe, Adyen, Checkout.com—have signaled multilateral support. Survey data suggests 57% of consumers feel comfortable with agents handling routine Orders. Furthermore, younger demographics exhibit higher trust. These trends motivate retailers to accelerate Adoption, yet integration timelines vary by region. Visa plans APAC and European pilots early 2026, targeting Global rollouts before peak shopping periods. Competitive pressure could speed convergence. However, conflicting token schemas might stall merchant decision making. Therefore, industry bodies must coordinate quickly. The competitive section underscores parallel initiatives. Consequently, the next topic tackles associated risks. Fraud Threats And Defenses AI also empowers attackers. Deloitte observed a 37% quarterly jump in fraudulent traffic during 2025. Additionally, retailers reported feeling underprepared for advanced bot tactics. Therefore, Visa’s partnership with Akamai focuses on layered defenses—behavioral analytics, agent attestation, and dynamic throttling. Moreover, agent-bound tokens reduce credential stuffing exposure. In contrast, static card-on-file data remains vulnerable. Visa’s Know Your Agent (KYA) vetting process further screens developers before production access. Consequently, issuers receive higher-confidence metadata and can lower false declines. Nevertheless, dispute processes remain ambiguous. Regulators will scrutinize liability rules once autonomous agents mis-order or overspend. Payments teams must map updated chargeback flows now. These defensive measures mitigate threats yet require ongoi",

(NYSE: V) today released new survey data, revealing AI’s influence in shopping and spending, a generational shift in consumer spending behavior, and emerging payments trends this holiday season.\n\n\"The data tells a fascinating story about the spending shift we're witnessing: shoppers are embracing AI and digital tools at remarkable speed, with nearly half of Americans now using AI to enhance their shopping experience,\" said Bruce Cundiff, vice president, Consumer Insights at Visa. \"From AI-powered gift discovery to cryptocurrency as a legitimate gift option, we're seeing Gen Z and younger millennials lead a fundamental reimagining of commerce.\"\n\n**AI and Crypto Become Mainstream This Year**\n\nThis holiday season marks a turning point in how Americans shop and gift. Consumers are increasingly weaving technologies like AI and digital currencies into their holiday traditions.\n\n* Nearly halfof US shoppers(47 percent) surveyed have used an AI tool for at least one shopping task, with “finding gift ideas” ranking as the top AI-assisted use.\n* When it comes to agentic commerce, price comparison is the most compelling application.\n* More thanone in four shoppers (28 percent) would be excited to receive cryptocurrency as a gift. That number skyrockets to 45 percent for Gen Z.\n* Approximately one in 10 shoppers believe stablecoins will take over by 2030, while 28 percent expect an increase in usage of stablecoins by 2035.\n\n**Gen Z Leads the Charge in Digital-First Consumer Behavior**\n\nGen Z continues to outpace other generations in adopting next-generation payment and shopping methods:\n\n* Gen Z is more likely to use biometric authentication (71 percent), purchase gifts from overseas (60 percent globally), buy from social platforms (55 percent), and make purchases via cryptocurrency (44 percent) than other age groups.\n* Globally, 41 percent say they plan to travel more this holiday season than last year.\n* While one in five shoppers now prefer their digital wallets, Gen Z is closing the gap. These younger consumers are just as likely to prefer digital wallets compared to physical cards, 36 percent to 34 percent, respectively.\n\n**Shoppers Want Smarter Tech – And More Trust**\n\nAs technology becomes central to the shopping journey, consumers are calling for transparency, security, and human connection:\n\n* As shoppers integrate AI into their routines, 61 percent prefer human interaction for customer service, and 60 percent want to better understand how AI-powered shopping tools use their personal data, signaling that transparency and trust will be key to driving broader adoption.\n* 66 percent of those surveyed worry friends or family could fall victim to an online scam this season, and 39 percent have encountered one in the past year.\n\n**Holiday Cheer Arrived Early**\n\nMore than a quarter of consumers surveyed began holiday shopping before November. Visa forecasts [4.6% year-over-year growth in total U.S. holiday spending](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcorporate.visa.com%2Fen%2Fsites%2Fvisa-perspectives%2Ftrends-insights%2F2025-holiday-spending-outlook.html&esheet=54366213&newsitemid=20251202478691&lan=en-US&anchor=4.6%25+year-over-year+growth+in+total+U.S.+holiday+spending&index=1&md5=14357189573fda3ca4252253c28d91e6), showing Americans’ determination to celebrate the season.\n\nTo learn more about the global results of this survey, [visit Visa Perspectives](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcorporate.visa.com%2Fen%2Fsites%2Fvisa-perspectives%2Ftrends-insights%2F2025-spending-shift-report.html&esheet=54366213&newsitemid=20251202478691&lan=en-US&anchor=visit+Visa+Perspectives&index=2&md5=86c6cc9ab4c6d6533c008349788ff3f9).\n\n**About the 2025 Holiday Spending Shift Survey**\n\nVisa commissioned Morning Consult to survey a sample of 1,000 U.S. adults between October 14 and October 16, 2025.

Totally normal. That future isn’t far off as consumers around the world warm up to these new technologies, according to new research conducted by Morning Consult on behalf of Visa.\n\n## A new global spending landscape\n\nAs consumers worldwide prepare for the 2025 holiday season, a new global study shows just how dramatically shopping behaviors are evolving across markets. The findings, drawn from 12 countries, present a clear shift: Consumers around the world are embracing new technologies.\n\nAcross all markets, AI, digital currencies and digital wallets are becoming entrenched in global holiday spending behavior. While convenience and security remain baseline expectations for payments, fraud concerns are still top of mind, heightening the need for continued education and a secure, trustworthy infrastructure. And Gen Z’s preferences are becoming the blueprint for the future of commerce.\n\n## AI shopping goes mainstream\n\nAcross markets, AI is becoming a trusted holiday companion, especially among deal-driven consumers:\n\n* Spain, Singapore, South Africa, the UAE, Brazil and Mexico show the highest rate of AI openness.\n* In the U.S., nearly half of consumers (47 percent) have already used AI for at least one shopping-related task, with gift discovery, price comparison and product research emerging as top holiday use cases across North America. This data signals the beginning of an [agentic AI](/en/products/intelligent-commerce.html) era where shoppers rely on intelligent tools not just to browse, but to make decisions too.\n\n## Crypto and stablecoins step into the holiday spotlight\n\nAcross markets, digital currencies are shifting from niche to normal, especially for younger generations.\n\n* Nearly half (45 percent) of Gen Z in the U.S. would be excited to receive cryptocurrency, nearly double the rate of all Americans, at 28 percent.\n* Stablecoins are gaining traction too: 41 percent of U.S. remittance users say they’re likely to use stablecoins for international money transfers in the future.\n\nGlobally, this openness to digital currencies is far from uniform. Brazil (65 percent), Mexico (62 percent), South Africa (57 percent) and the UAE (66 percent) remittance users show the strongest willingness to adopt stablecoins in the future. UK consumers are warming to stablecoins (36 percent), while Germany remains cautious (23 percent).\n\n## More shoppers are reaching for digital wallets this holiday\n\nDigital wallets are gaining global dominance, especially among younger generations. In the U.S., one in five shoppers already prefer digital wallets, and Gen Z is driving the shift. They are just as likely to use a digital wallet as a physical card (36 percent vs. 34 percent).\n\nWorldwide, digital wallet adoption patterns reveal striking contrasts across regions:\n\n* Singapore and the UAE lead the world, where digital wallets outperform cards and cash on trust, security, speed and convenience.\n* Brazil shows a strong preference for digital wallets, driven by acceptance, speed and perceived fraud protection.\n* Germany remains a cash stronghold, a sharp departure from the UK, which leads other EU markets in digital wallet experience.\n\nEven in markets where cash remains culturally important, consumers expect future decline. Across Europe, many anticipate that cash usage will fall over the next decade, underscoring a broader, steady movement toward digital payments.\n\n## Security and trust shape holiday shopping decisions\n\nSecurity is the single biggest factor influencing payment choice globally, with 79 percent of respondents saying it is extremely important. Consumers want frictionless payments yet they fear that fraud schemes are becoming too sophisticated. U.S. consumers are particularly concerned this season:\n\n* 66 percent worry that friends or family may fall for an online scam\n* 82 percent have taken proactive steps to protect themselves through two-factor authentication, frequent password changes and other measures\n\nFraud exposure differs widely by country. Surveyed countries in CEMEA and Latin America report the highest levels of online payment scams, while surveyed countries in Europe show the lowest.\n\n## Gen Z is redefining how the world shops\n\nIf there is one generational force emerging from the study, it’s Gen Z.

Dive Brief: Visa pegged U.S. holiday spending growth at 4.2% compared to last year, while Mastercard’s SpendingPulse report calculated that U.S. spending between Nov. 1 and Dec. 21 grew 3.9% year over year, according to analysis from the respective payments giants released in December. Though 73% of holiday transactions occurred in physical stores, consumers made 27% of holiday purchases online, with online retail spending rising 7.8% compared to last year, per Visa’s analysis. Similarly, Mastercard tracked a 7.4% jump in holiday e-commerce sales. The two reports reached different conclusions on apparel sales growth. Visa tallied a 5.3% jump in clothing and accessories sales, but Mastercard found a 7.8% increase in apparel sales. Dive Insight: Mastercard and Visa’s results aren’t far off from pre-season holiday forecasts. In September, Bain & Company projected a 4% jump in retail sales in November and December, with a 2.75% bump in in-store sales. Visa and Mastercard’s respective reports offer some insight into the split between online and in-store sales. Visa attributed the rise in e-commerce sales in part to early-season promotions and convenience for shoppers. Still, in-store sales saw a 2.9% bump from a year earlier, which Mastercard attributes to “the convergence of blended shopping experiences,” per its report. “Whether shoppers were upgrading their tech, refreshing their closets, or stocking up at one‑stop shops, retailers delivered seamless shopping experiences both in stores and online,” Wayne Best, chief economist at Visa, said in a press release. “This season also marked a turning point, with artificial intelligence shaping how people discover products, compare prices, and interact with offers. This led to a more informed, more intentional consumer, ensuring they could stretch their discretionary spending.” Other research suggests that shoppers sought to stretch their budgets during the season. An ICSC survey published in October found that 64% of shoppers planned to take more time in their discount search and 67% anticipated more trips to stores to look for deals. Furthermore, almost two-thirds of respondents said they would shop at discount department stores, the survey found. Beyond searching for discounts, shoppers employed other strategies to make the most of their holiday funds, including using buy now, pay later services and shopping earlier. An Adobe Analytics analysis found that BNPL drove $1.03 billion in online spend on Cyber Monday, up 4.2% from a year earlier. “Consumers demonstrated flexibility and confidence this season, shopping early, leveraging promotions, and investing in meaningful experiences and wish-list items,” Michelle Meyer, chief economist at Mastercard Economics Institute, said in a statement. “They also blended online and in-store shopping to find the best deals and maximize convenience.” purchase licensing rights Filed Under: Consumer Trends, Holidays",

    "extractedText": "Despite handling over 21.7 billion parcels in 2023, the US last-mile delivery sector remains outdated in terms of the customer experience it offers. Major carriers like FedEx, UPS, USPS, and Amazon dominate the market, controlling 97% of deliveries, but even they struggle to meet the evolving expectations of their customers. While the overall volume of deliveries continues to rise, many consumers feel dissatisfied with the service they receive, citing issues such as vague delivery windows, limited tracking information, and a lack of flexibility in adjusting delivery options. A recent survey conducted by Triangle Management Services, commissioned by Bettermile, highlights this gap between consumer expectations and reality. According to the study, 89% of consumers place high importance on parcel visibility to better plan their daily schedules. Yet, only 19% of deliveries offer a time window of two hours or less on the day of delivery. Furthermore, 47% of consumers are either never or rarely given the option to make same-day changes to their delivery. The breakthrough of food-delivery and ride-hailing services has increased the demand for transparency and customer centricity for regular last-mile delivery. Yet many providers still fall short of these expectations. At the same time, the explosion of e-commerce, driven by consumer convenience and accelerated by the global pandemic, has placed last-mile delivery companies under increasing pressure to balance operational efficiency with customer satisfaction. In other markets, the use of customer-oriented and efficiency-enhancing technologies is more widespread. In Europe, major carriers such as DHL and GLS have widely adopted advanced tracking. Consumers can track their deliveries live on a map and delivery windows narrow down to 15 minutes in some cases as the vehicle arrives. In China, e-commerce sites offer highly sophisticated parcel tracking systems, including complete visibility of the driver’s location in relation to the delivery destination and dynamic estimated times of arrival (ETAs). In emerging markets such as Brazil, we see massive adoption of advanced tracking technologies, driven by companies like Loggi, who also offer an Uber-like delivery experience. The Changing Consumer Expectations In an era where services like DoorDash, Uber Eats, and Lyft have raised the bar for real-time tracking and customer communication, consumers expect the same level of visibility and control when it comes to receiving their packages. These apps allow users to track their rides or food deliveries in real time, receive dynamic updates, and adjust their plans accordingly. It is no surprise that consumers now expect similar experiences when waiting for a package. However, the reality is quite different. Traditional package delivery systems still rely on scan-based updates at fixed checkpoints, such as \"out for delivery\" or \"delivered.\" This results in vague delivery windows, forcing consumers to stay home all day for important deliveries. Additionally, without dynamic ETAs or real-time tracking, there is an increased risk of porch piracy – one of the most prevalent problems that affects nearly half of all Americans, according to a study by Security.org. How AI Is Revolutionizing Last-Mile Delivery Artificial intelligence is proving to be a game-changer in addressing many of these challenges. By leveraging AI-powered solutions such as predictive analytics, dynamic route optimization, and real-time communication between drivers and recipients, last-mile delivery companies can create a more efficient and customer-friendly delivery process. Here’s how AI can help solve some of the most pressing problems in last-mile delivery: 1. Predictive Analytics and Dynamic ETAs AI-driven predictive analytics can dramatically improve the accuracy of delivery time estimates. By analyzing historical delivery data and real-time conditions (such as traffic, weather, and the number of stops a driver needs to make), machine learning models can calculate precise delivery windows, often narrowing them down to an hour or less. This technology provides dynamic ETAs that adjust as a delivery progresses, much like ride-hailing apps do. 2. Route Optimization AI-powered route optimization tools can help delivery companies reduce delivery times, fuel costs, and operational inefficiencies. Traditional route planning methods often result in suboptimal delivery paths, with drivers making unnecessary detours or facing unexpected delays. AI, however, can analyze vast amounts of data to generate optimal routes that account for real-time variables like traffic conditions, road closures, and customer availability. By optimizing routes in real time, delivery drivers can avoid congested areas, make more stops in less time, and adjust their paths dynamically as conditions change. This not only increases operational efficiency but also improves the chances of successful first-attempt deliveries, further reducing co",

With customer expectations increasing, more businesses implement technology to expedite shipping requests, and several notable trends in the last-mile delivery market are emerging. Last-Mile Delivery Explained Last-mile delivery is a term that typically refers to the final leg of a package's journey to a residential address. It can also include businesses and other destinations. Last-mile delivery is commonly considered the most challenging and costly part of the delivery process because it involves navigating complex residential areas to deliver packages to individual homes and buildings. An ever-evolving field, last-mile delivery is influenced by various trends and statistics, including technological advancements, consumer demands, and logistics challenges. In the current market, many businesses are discovering advanced technologies that improve their mobile operations’ efficiency, irrespective of the size of their fleet or number of drivers, reducing costs and improving customer service. Current and Future Trends in Last-Mile Delivery Innovation The e-commerce industry is largely driving the growth of the last-mile delivery industry. With the increasing popularity of online shopping, the demand for last-mile delivery services is expected to grow. According to recent statistics, the global Last-Mile Delivery for the E-commerce market was worth USD $38.5 million in 2021 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12.1% over the forecast period, reaching USD $76.5 million by 2027. Consumers today have higher expectations and want same-day or next-day delivery options and complete transparency throughout the shipping process. Meeting these demands and providing a positive customer experience is critical for cultivating brand loyalty and remaining competitive in the current and future marketplace. Last-mile delivery innovation and technology are making it possible to meet market demands and more. Businesses increasingly leverage smart technology, drones, delivery robots, and electric vehicles to help streamline operations, reduce costs, and improve delivery times. While trends vary depending on location, industry, and the specific needs of each delivery, we will look at these innovative technologies in greater detail below. Smart Tech and Real-Time Tracking Customers want more certainty, convenience, and visibility in their delivery options. Therefore, companies must find new ways to meet the expectations of consumers and businesses, who want precise delivery times and the assurance that their purchases will arrive on time. Real-time tracking using smart technology plays a major role in supporting a faster and more transparent last-mile delivery process to connect the planned delivery time to the current whereabouts. With the use of IoT-enabled sensors and GPS-enabled devices, every shipment movement can be tracked. Further, artificial intelligence and machine learning technology, like Tourmo AI, is being deployed to analyze data to predict demand and anticipate potential problems while automating many operational processes required to streamline the entire delivery process. Companies that do not use smart tech should evaluate their current technology solutions and consider incorporating this technology to optimize their last-mile delivery operations by making them highly transparent and reliable. Hybrid Fleet Management Systems and Insourcing Many businesses are incorporating the latest last-mile delivery trend, “hybrid fleet management.” It combines a trucking company's vehicles with outside contractors, third-party providers, and freelance drivers to adjust the fleet size to match fluctuations in demand and keep capital costs down. Conversely, many companies manage the last-mile delivery internally, using their own fleet vehicles or a combination of company-owned and contracted vehicles, rather than outsourcing the delivery. Businesses that go for this option, a.k.a. insourcing, can gain better control over their delivery operations while avoiding some of the downsides of conventional outsourcing. Despite this, outsourcing remains the preferred choice, with many companies collaborating with third parties to decrease last-mile delivery expenses. The hybrid fleet management trend has led some third-party logistics providers to create their own local delivery service to rival insourcing, complete with vehicles and personnel for local deliveries.

    "extractedText": "1\n\nWouter Baan, Joshua Chang, and \n\nChristopher Thomas HOW ADVANCED INDUSTRIAL COMPANIES SHOULD APPROACH ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE STRATEGY \n\nNovember 2017 \n\n# Leaders need to determine what AI can do for their company by looking at potential applications and scenarios, and then building their approach around those findings. Artificial intelligence (AI) has reached a commercialization tipping point. As a result of several technology advancements that are now converging, major investments by technology companies and start-ups, and demand from businesses, AI is starting to have a major impact across markets. Advanced industries such as automotive, semiconductors, and industrial manufacturing could harness AI over the next decade to discover entirely new ways to make things better, cheaper, and faster. While popular reporting on the topic often tends to focus only on generating new business ideas, companies can directly apply AI to their current core business processes and operations. However, many companies have yet to think through how they could embed AI in their strategies and businesses. Instead, they take ad hoc approaches that might not scale up, cannot prove the worth of new technologies, and fail to build systematic capabilities. Ultimately, such efforts make little impact. \n\nHype galore, but many businesses are not yet clear on using AI technology \n\nWhile projections vary, forecasters seem to align on an annual AI revenue growth rate of roughly 50 percent. Analysts are bullish about AI, claiming it has the potential to drive significant productivity improvements via the automation of multitudes of manual tasks across nearly every industry. While the hype surrounding AI has reached critical mass, many companies remain unsure what to do with the technology. For example, one big concern: in a McKinsey survey of respondents from Chinese companies, results showed that AI is not a strategic priority for 43 percent of C-level executives. 2McKinsey Center for Future Mobility How advanced industrial companies should approach artificial-intelligence strategy At the same time, the top three barriers to executing AI were the lack of required talent and capabilities, AI technology not being mature, and top management not being clear on the value of AI (Exhibit 1). \n\nOne big challenge is that artificial intelligence is not a strategic priority \n\nWeb 2017 How automotive players should approach AI strategy Exhibit 1 of 2 \n\nIs AI technology a strategic priority for the CEO or C-level executive team? \n\nPercentage of respondents \n\nWhat is the top barrier to artificial-intelligence (AI) application in your company? \n\n1. Talent and knowledge 2. AI technology maturity 3. Top management unclear about AI value 4. Difficult to identify business use cases 5. Regulatory support 6. Data availability 7. Computing infrastructure \n\n43 11 46 Not a strategic priority or on CEO’s agenda Top priority 1 of the strategic priorities \n\n> Source: McKinsey analysis\n\nExhibit 1 How to define an AI strategy \n\nGiven the buzz and confusion that surrounds AI in general, business leaders need to determine what the technology can and cannot do for their company, and build an AI strategy based on those findings. Typical steps include identifying potential applications, playing out scenarios of AI-generated industry disruptions, defining a strategic stance and selecting underlying AI initiatives, and making the AI transformation happen. The first two steps focus on understanding how the external environment could evolve, while the second two cover what the company should do about it. 3McKinsey Center for Future Mobility 3McKinsey Center for Future Mobility \n\nIdentify potential AI applications \n\nFirst, move quickly from big-picture concepts to concrete, specific applications where AI creates business value (either sooner or later). Generate a list of these real-world applications by discussing the topic with everyone, including venture capitalists, research labs, the company’s IT department, and consultants, and by conducting internal brainstorming. It often proves helpful to brainstorm on the applications along three archetypes. For example, operational enhancements could cover research, product development, manufacturing, supply chain management, or marketing and sales. This might include introducing AI-enhanced predictive maintenance in manufacturing or developing R&D applications that could recommend modification areas to drive productivity. Another archetype focuses on product innovations, such as automated driver-assistance system modules, or even new business models. The latter likely builds on the earlier two, for example, using an autonomous-driving system to unlock shared-mobility and in-car services. Once identified, assess the level of potential disruption each AI application could deliver using seven product and value chain questions. Product questions: \n\n Does it provide an efficiency boost or cost reduction? \n\n Can it enable product sub",

Already, nearly 70 percent of top economic performers, versus just half of their peers, use their own software to differentiate themselves from their competitors. One-third of those top performers directly monetize software.1“[Three new mandates for capturing a digital transformation’s full value](/capabilities/tech-and-ai/our-insights/three-new-mandates-for-capturing-a-digital-transformations-full-value),” McKinsey, June 15, 2022. Generative AI (gen AI) offers a tantalizing opportunity to increase this value opportunity by helping software talent create better code faster.\n\n[Promising experiments that use gen AI](/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/how-generative-ai-could-accelerate-software-product-time-to-market) to support coding tasks show impressive productivity improvements. Gen AI has improved product manager (PM) productivity by 40 percent, while [halving the time it takes](/capabilities/tech-and-ai/our-insights/unleashing-developer-productivity-with-generative-ai) to document and code. At IBM Software, for example, developers using gen AI saw 30 to 40 percent jumps in productivity.2Shivani Shinde, “IBM Software sees 30-40% productivity gains among developers using GenAI,” *Business Standard*, July 9, 2024.\n\nSidebar\n\n## About McKinsey Technology\n\n**McKinsey Technology** works with organizations across the private, public, and social sectors to create opportunities around cloud, data transformation, tech strategy, risk and remediation, and artificial intelligence. McKinsey Technology comprises more than 2,500 people in every geography—developers, engineers, architects, strategists, and analysts—who bring together technical expertise and deep industry knowledge. We work closely with organizations to deliver the technology transformation they need today and build the capabilities to embrace what comes next.\n\nDespite its promise, gen AI has barely revealed its full potential. While some 65 percent of respondents to the recent [McKinsey Global Survey on the state of AI](/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai-2024) report that they are regularly using gen AI, only 13 percent are systematically using gen AI in software engineering.3“[The state of AI in early 2024: Gen AI adoption spikes and starts to generate value](/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai-2024),” McKinsey, May 30, 2024. Our own experience working with companies reveals that gen AI tools currently help with about 10 to 20 percent of the coding activities of a developer.\n\nSidebar\n\n## About QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey\n\n**QuantumBlack,** McKinsey’s AI arm, helps companies transform using the power of technology, technical expertise, and industry experts.

Yet for most organizations, the gap between what’s possible and what’s implemented is steadily widening. A [2024 McKinsey Global Survey](/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/gen-ais-next-inflection-point-from-employee-experimentation-to-organizational-transformation) found that nine in ten employees used gen AI for their work, and 21 percent of them were heavy users.1Charlotte Relyea, Dana Maor, Sandra Durth, and Jan Bouly, “[Gen AI’s next inflection point: From employee experimentation to organizational transformation](/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/gen-ais-next-inflection-point-from-employee-experimentation-to-organizational-transformation),” McKinsey, August 7, 2024. But while employee enthusiasm was high, the formal adoption of AI tools across most organizations lagged behind: Only 13 percent of surveyed employees considered their organization to be an early adopter.\n\nThe slow institutional embrace of new tools isn’t a new phenomenon. It happened when digital natives collaborated using cloud-based platforms and connected with customers via social media years before their employers officially approved these technologies. More recently, mobile natives started conducting business through messaging apps and mobile-first workflows while corporate IT departments were still debating smartphone security policies. Now the world is witnessing the emergence of AI natives—typically, younger employees—who are already using gen AI tools to draft emails, write code, and analyze data, while decision-makers and budget holders worry about governance and up-front technology costs.\n\nThe differences this time are the speed and scale of change. The time between gen AI capabilities being a competitive advantage and becoming a competitive necessity is dramatically shorter than it was in earlier technological transitions. Organizations that master the art of fast adoption will determine the new rules of their industries.\n\n> The time between gen AI capabilities being a competitive advantage and becoming a competitive necessity is dramatically shorter than it was in earlier technological transitions.\n\nBut how do leaders accelerate learning across an entire organization without sacrificing quality or creating chaos? How do they ensure that the enterprise gets the most value out of dispersed pockets of innovation? We discuss four mindsets and practices that can help.\n\n## Nurture what’s already growing\n\nIn the book *The Gardener and the Carpenter: What the New Science of Child Development Tells Us About the Relationship Between Parents and Children* (Farrar, Straus and Giroux/Macmillan Publishers, 2016), developmental psychologist Alison Gopnik argues that parents should allow children to develop according to their natural tendencies rather than predetermined constructs. This concept, which she calls a “gardener’s mindset,” is as relevant to organizational leaders as to parents: Nurture the growth that you see. The most successful managers focus on identifying the sprouts—employees, teams, or departments that are experimenting with new technologies and showing promising early results. They ask, “Where is innovation already happening? Who is solving problems in surprisingly effective ways?”\n\nMost organizations, however, favor the “carpenter’s mindset”: meticulously planning every detail of technological transformation from the top down. This approach can’t keep pace with the current rate of change. Leaders who try to specify precisely how AI should be implemented across their organizations often find themselves building yesterday’s solutions for tomorrow’s problems.\n\n> Leaders who try to specify precisely how AI should be implemented across their organizations often find themselves building yesterday’s solutions for tomorrow’s problems.\n\nConsider the experience of an Asian financial-services company that found i",

Instead of simply automating existing processes, forward-thinking organizations are reimagining entire domains of work. This requires fundamentally rethinking how value is created and delivered, and it can only be realized through a bold, strategic approach to [change management](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/the-organization-blog/tag/change-management).\n\n**To fully harness the power of gen AI, organizations must recognize that technology alone is not enough.** While employees [are already ahead](/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/gen-ais-next-inflection-point-from-employee-experimentation-to-organizational-transformation) in experimenting with and understanding gen AI, organizational systems often lag behind. One way companies can start to catch up is through a thoughtful change management plan to enable and sustain the use of gen AI.\n\nDrawing on insights from first movers, we have identified four critical strategies that form the foundation for embedding gen AI within an organization. These can help foster a resilient, adaptive [culture](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/the-organization-blog/tag/culture) that not only withstands but thrives amidst rapid evolution.\n\n1. **Reframe gen AI as enabler of human potential**\n\n   Reframe gen AI as a tool that enhances, rather than replaces, human potential. Resistance often arises from fears of the unknown. Clearly communicate that it will augment work in a way that empowers employees to focus on higher-value activities. This shift in narrative reduces resistance and positions [AI as a catalyst](/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/the-organization-blog/how-generative-ai-could-support-not-replace-human-resources) for career growth.\n\n   Additionally, sharing real-world examples of how AI has been able to truly augment workflows and drive significant business outcomes can demystify it, make it relatable, and inspire employees to embrace its potential.\n\n   Acknowledging technology’s challenges and limitations, and inviting employees to help refine, can foster ownership and trust. This transparency can help deepen commitment as well, as employees see themselves as [active participants](/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/the-organization-blog/middle-managers-hold-the-key-to-unlock-generative-ai) in shaping the AI-driven future.\n2. **Gain insight from resistance**\n\n   Resistance is often perceived as a hurdle, but it can be a crucial source of insight when approached strategically. Engaging non-adopters early in the gen AI journey can help identify and address potential biases and resistance points before they escalate. These critical voices often surface challenges that early adopters might overlook, providing valuable feedback that can enhance and refine deployment.",

Easing the Pressure on Marketing.**  \nMarketing leaders face demands from every side. Content must evolve quickly, consumers have higher expectations for personalized journeys, and ROI is harder to prove. GenAI offers a path forward, reducing complexity and providing teams with sharper analysis and insights. To utilize the technology to its fullest, CMOs need to rethink how the entire function operates—from brand building to execution.  \n  \n**What’s Possible? A Stronger, Faster Function.**  \nTo get the most from GenAI, strive for the transformation of marketing across three pillars:  \n\n* **The Art of Brand Building.** GenAI can boost the creative side of marketing by building content faster and projecting your distinctive voice across channels.\n* **The Science of End-to-End Activation.** How do you achieve better insights and enhance consumer activation? Put GenAI to work analyzing data, optimizing your media, and boosting your ROI.\n* **The Orchestration of Your Portfolio.** AI can augment your decision making, planning, and project management with deep customer understanding and automated simulation.\n\nThe benefits show throughout the function. With GenAI, content cycles drop from six to ten months to just one or two. AI lets teams personalize at scale; marketing leaders can reduce expenses. You can now capture up to six times the ROI with end-to-end transformation.  \n  \n**Where to Start? Focus on Full-Funnel Workflows.**  \nCMOs should plan to engage AI in core areas:  \n\n* **Streamline content creation.** Use AI to automate briefs, speed up ideation, and make it easier to adapt content for channels and personalization.\n* **Optimize campaign activation.** Use data and automation to simplify planning, execute plans with more precision, and improve ROI.\n* **Sharpen portfolio planning.** Make faster investment decisions based on clearer insights and more effective tradeoffs.\n\nIt’s not just about new tools—it’s about reshaping how marketing teams work. The time is right to build a more agile, more effective function that’s fit for the future.  \n  \n[**Explore the Future of Marketing**](https://media-publications.bcg.com/BCG-Executive-Perspectives-The-Future-of-Marketing-with-GenAI-EP16-13June2025.pdf)\n\nThe Sales Leader’s Guide\n\nThe Sales Leader’s Guide\n\n**What’s the Challenge?

To be an industry leader tomorrow, you need a clear and compelling generative AI adoption strategy today.\n\n[Artificial intelligence](https://www.bcg.com/capabilities/artificial-intelligence) has reached a generational inflection point. With GenAI investments projected to increase by 60% in the next three years, [AI and GenAI ambitions](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2025/closing-the-ai-impact-gap) continue to grow across all sectors and functions.  \n  \nBut only [one in four executives](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2025/ai-fitness-for-ceos) say their companies are seeing significant returns from their AI and GenAI investments. To succeed, leaders must identify the critical business benefits of generative AI, targeting a handful of high-value initiatives that drive GenAI ROI.\n\nTech + Us: Harness the power of technology and AI\n[Manage Subscriptions](/subscription)\n\n## The Expansive Power of Generative AI\n\nWhat is the difference between generative AI and predictive AI (traditional AI)? \n\nAugmented by human interaction, predictive AI focuses on pattern recognition, forecasting outcomes, or making decisions based on historical data; it excels at tasks like classification, recommendations, and automation of rule-based processes.  \n  \nThe benefits of generative AI include helping humans create seemingly new content—text, images, code—based on what it has learned from data. The most powerful generative AI algorithms are built on top of foundation models that are trained on a vast quantity of unlabeled data to identify underlying patterns for a wide range of tasks. While significant generative AI customization still requires human expertise, adopting a generative model for a specific task can be accomplished with relatively low quantities of data or examples through APIs or by prompt engineering.\n\nWhat is the difference between generative AI and AI agents? \n\nGenerative AI powers the underlying capability to create content and understand complex instructions. [AI agents](https://www.bcg.com/capabilities/artificial-intelligence/ai-agents) go a step further—they use generative models to pursue goals; to reason, plan, and execute tasks across systems. While generative AI might write a report, an agent can interpret a business objective, gather the right data, write the report, and send it to the right people. Think of generative AI as an engine and AI agents as goal-oriented (digital) coworkers powered by that engine to act across systems, both guided and supervised by humans.\n\nHow is generative AI beneficial for businesses? \n\nThe biggest benefits of generative AI show up when GenAI initiatives are tied to core business functions, not just experiments. Enterprises benefit most when they move beyond isolated pilots and use GenAI to transform foundational workflows linked to strategic priorities. GenAI turns manual processes into fast, data-driven cycles, and is already unlocking tangible productivity gains across areas like software development, customer service (for example, smarter contact centers), marketing content, and R&D.\n\nWhat is the biggest challenge facing organizations that want to implement generative AI? \n\nThe biggest challenge to GenAI ROI is not the tech—it’s the people and the process. This type of change management is often overlooked, but top-performing organizations follow the 10-20-70 principle: they dedicate 10% of their efforts to algorithms; 20% to data and technology; and 70% to people, processes, and cultural transformation. Successful GenAI adoption requires redesigning how work gets done, redefining roles, upskilling teams, and fostering collaboration between humans and AI. Without this shift, even the best transformation efforts will fail to achieve their goals. Business leaders who invest in training and change management position their organizations to effectively accelerate generative AI adoption.\n\nWhat are the risks of generative AI? \n\nGenerative AI systems are democratizing AI capabilities that were previously inaccessible due to the lack of training data and required computing power. While wider GenAI adoption is a good thing, scaling generative AI become problematic when organizations don’t have an appropriate [responsible AI](https://www.bcg.com/capabilities/artificial-intelligence/responsible-ai) (RAI) framework in place from day one of deployment. As users experiment with these systems, generative AI risks need to be addressed:  \n\n* **Unknown Capabilities.** Large GenAI systems have exhibited a massive capability overhang—skills and dangers that are not planned for in the development phase and are generally unknown and unexpected even to the developers. This can pose a serious threat if the right guardrails are not in place to e",

It's designed to make integrations fast and flexible to account for every retailer's requirements.\n\n“Shopify has a history of building checkouts for millions of unique retail businesses. We have taken everything we’ve seen over the decades to make UCP a robust commerce standard that can scale,” says Vanessa Lee, VP Shopify. “Agentic commerce has so much potential to redefine shopping and we want to make sure it can scale to every product a customer might want to purchase.”\n\nWith UCP, agents can represent critical checkout flows for a smooth transaction in any AI platform. That means customers will be able to: submit discount codes, input loyalty credentials, select preferred subscription billing cadences, or confirm selling terms like final sale or pre-order timing in chat. The protocol also works with any payment processor, including Shopify Payments.\n\nWhether building fully conversational purchasing experiences, embedded checkouts in apps, or web-based commerce flows, agentic partners using UCP get the flexibility to support any shopping experience. In fact, it’s designed for all types of transactions, not just for retail commerce but also for other verticals in the future.\n\nWith UCP, agents can natively complete checkout on a customer’s behalf with a flexible architecture that adapts to any commerce stack using REST, Model Context Protocol (MCP), Agent Payments Protocol (AP2), or Agent2Agent (A2A) protocols. In the instances where a customer's interaction is required—take a furniture retailer that requires a customer to select a specific delivery date and time—UCP gives a standard way for that furniture retailer to specify to agents what information is needed from customers in the checkout flow.\n\n“The shift to agentic commerce will require a shared language across the ecosystem—and the Universal Commerce Protocol provides that framework,” says Ashish Gupta, VP/GM of Merchant Shopping at Google. “Through our collaboration with partners like Shopify we’re ensuring the protocol is interoperable and ready to meet the evolving demands of retailers and their customers. We’re excited to work together and bring this to life soon starting with a new checkout feature in AI Mode in Google S",
