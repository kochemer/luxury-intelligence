AI tools encompass any software that leverages artificial intelligence technologies to streamline business operations and processes. These intelligent solutions use varying combinations of machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and generative AI to tackle specific business challenges. The AI landscape has expanded dramatically, offering specialized tools across virtually every business function—from legal AI tools to sophisticated content generation systems. While these tools employ different AI techniques and serve diverse purposes, they share a common objective: enhancing your organization’s productivity and efficiency through automation and intelligent assistance. Organizations are embracing AI to gain a competitive edge in today’s market. By leveraging artificial intelligence, businesses can quickly process massive amounts of information, spot patterns and trends that humans might miss, and make more data-driven decisions. AI is also enabling companies to create personalized customer experiences, streamline operations, and develop innovative products and services. The benefits of implementing AI solutions are substantial. Companies using AI report increased efficiency, lower operational costs, and higher customer satisfaction rates. For example, AI-powered chatbots can handle customer inquiries around the clock, freeing up human agents to tackle more complex issues. Meanwhile, AI analytics tools can uncover valuable insights from business data, helping organizations identify new opportunities and minimize potential risks. Why modern businesses are embracing artificial intelligence Several key factors drive the rapid adoption of different AI tools and solutions across different industries: AI can improve efficiency and productivity. It can automate repetitive tasks, freeing up employees for higher-value work. For instance, AI-powered document processing can extract key information from invoices or contracts in seconds, which would take humans much longer. AI leads to better decision-making. It enables businesses to find better solutions faster by quickly analyzing huge amounts of data. This is particularly helpful in financial forecasting, where AI can uncover trends better than traditional methods. AI can help customize customer experiences. AI lets businesses tailor their products, services, and communications to customer preferences. This level of customization can greatly improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.

In this article, we explore how generative AI can serve as a catalyst for retailers to operate their stores leaner and more cost-efficiently, while providing store associates with enhanced knowledge and decision support. Furthermore, we believe that generative AI has the potential to fuel new growth for retailers, particularly by improving the customer shopping experience through hyper-personalized offers. Here, we delve into the impact of generative AI on store operations and the workforce, showcasing accessible and ready-to-implement use cases that can generate high impact in these early stages of technology adoption. Two key benefits of generative AI in retail store operations The adoption of generative AI in stores brings forth a twofold benefit: driving cost and productivity improvements and fueling new growth. Together, these benefits create a virtuous cycle that propels businesses forward. 1. AI can drive retil cost and productivity improvements Imagine a store where 40% to 60% of human tasks are automated using AI. First-line managers (such as store managers and shift leaders) believe that 45% of their own jobs could be automated by generative AI, which aligns with various expert views. In contrast, entry-level blue-collar employees think only 36% of their jobs could be automated by AI. However, experts believe the potential for automation in these roles is much higher, in the range of 60% or more. Generative AI acts as a catalyst for efficiency and effectiveness in store operations in the following three areas. Streamlining repetitive tasks of store associates. Generative AI can automate recurring tasks, such as employee labor scheduling, predictive maintenance of store equipment, routine customer inquiries (for instance returns or exchanges), or onboarding of new colleagues, freeing up employees’ time to focus on higher-value activities like customer interaction and sales opportunities.Enabling better and faster decision-making by augmenting (not replacing) human expertise with generative AI “copilots.” For example, generative AI can support associates in answering more complex customer questions or supporting inventory management and production planning decisions.Elevating the role of store management by shifting focus from task execution to validation and action-taking. For example, generative AI can support store and department managers through automated reporting analysis, summary of insights, and action planning based on multiple daily store and department performance reports, alerting compliance issues, flagging waste reduction opportunities, or detecting fraud in stores. 2. AI solutions can fuel new retail growth New growth is driven mainly by three types of generative AI solutions. Solutions that support store associates in better serving customers, for example by using generative AI copilots to help answer basic or more complex customer questions (for instance, “Help me find a healthy cereal option for kids under $5.”)Reallocating time freed up by generative AI solutions, for example time savings from automating repetitive tasks and supporting decision-making can be invested in activities highly valued by customers.End-customer-directed sales and profitability-driving generative AI solutions, for example: Hyper-personalized customer outreach, such as promotions and product recommendations, leveraging data at scale for improved relevance; offering unique services like meal inspiration and planning through AI copilots; or redirecting increased productivity toward innovation, particularly in merchandising and marketing functions. Solutions in the last category are primarily driven by leveraging generative AI in upstream functions, such as marketing and merchandizing, and are less prevalent in the hands of store operators. However, as we take an end-to-end view of the impact of generative AI on omni-channel shopping, we did not want to miss mentioning these opportunities in this article. Our most recent research shows that consumers’ interest in user-facing AI solutions is currently limited. This is particularly driven by concerns around data privacy issues. Personalized promotions, however, are an area of high interest and where generative AI can unlock material benefits. Despite limited interest, retailers should still find value in exploring generative AI solutions and building capabilities because, at some point, customers will be interested. How generative AI can boost productivity and empower store workers Imagine equipping every store associate with a tool that amplifies their capabilities. That’s the promise of generative AI. Unlike traditional large language models (LLMs), generative AI is accessible for the masses, easy, and user-friendly. Implementing generative AI into stores does not require over-engineered change management",

From cashier-less checkout systems to the adoption of augmented reality for immersive shopping, companies are transforming traditional retail operations to meet modern-day demands. Generative AI, a recent technology, is rapidly becoming a game-changing solution in the retail industry. It helps retailers enhance customer engagement, streamline operational efficiency, and boost profitability in innovative ways. More than 69% of retailers witnessed increased revenue and 72% experienced cost reduction in operations due to using GenAI. Retailers are using GenAI to personalize marketing content, automate supply chains, and even design new products as per consumer preferences (Source: NVidea). This article explores the growing influence of generative AI in retail, delving into its benefits, challenges, and real-world applications. By examining recent advancements and use cases, we will uncover how retailers leverage GenAI to stay ahead in the retail landscape. What is Generative AI? Generative AI is a subset of artificial intelligence that creates new content—such as text, images, videos, or designs—based on patterns learned from existing data. It uses advanced models such as GPT or GANs to generate realistic and contextually relevant outputs, transforming industries such as retail with innovation. Different types of GenAI are available today, each serving a particular purpose. Text generation models such as GPT create human-like text for applications like chatbots, content creation, and personalized marketing. They help brands create attractive messages based on customer preferences. Image generation models powered by GANs design visuals, such as product designs, marketing creatives, or even virtual try-on solutions that enhance customer engagement. These are primarily implemented in the fashion retail industry. Voice generation models, such as text-to-speech (TTS), enhance customer service by delivering lifelike audio through virtual assistants and interactive shopping experiences, making customer journeys more engaging and compelling. GenAI-driven innovations in retail are likely to power virtual try-ons, dynamic pricing models, and real-time inventory optimization. As the impact and adoption increase, it will become even more crucial for retailers to stay ahead of evolving consumer demands while delivering an improved customer experience. Impact of Generative AI on the Retail Industry Generative AI is transforming retail by enhancing customer experience and automating operations through improving decision-making across the value chain. It enables hyper-personalized marketing and smarter product recommendations through immersive virtual try-ons, optimizing inventory and supply chains through back-office workflows. Marketing and Sales Generative AI is revolutionizing marketing by crafting hyper-personalized campaigns based on customer behavior and preferences, generating tailored product recommendations, email content, and advertisements. Retailers leverage AI-generated insights to identify trends and create strategies that target them, optimizing conversion rates and boosting sales. Customer Services Retailers use generative AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants to offer 24/7 customer support. These tools manage everything from product recommendations to order tracking and returns, with immediate and accurate responses. This decreases the dependency on human agents while guaranteeing consistent quality in service. Customer Experience Generative AI enables virtual try-ons, AI-assisted styling, and immersive product visualization to enhance the shopping experience.

Retailers and consumer brands are at various stages of this digital journey, each seeking tailored solutions to propel their businesses forward. To kick-start digital transformation, organizations need data-based insights that help them deliver on business outcomes. Accessing and acting on these insights is simpler than ever because of technologies such as data lakes, machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI). Elevating retail to new heights with generative AI In the dynamic world of retail and consumer goods, generative AI is a catalyst for transformative change. It’s transforming how companies interact with customers, manage operations, and drive growth. The potential of generative AI is incredibly exciting, with Goldman Sachs forecasting a 7-percent increase in global GDP and productivity growth of 1.5 percentage points over the span of 10 years. Automating product marketing Retailers and consumer goods brands can use Amazon Bedrock, large language models (LLMs), and multi-modal models for intelligent product analysis and descriptive writing. These models can ensure product accuracy, as well as optimize product descriptions for search engine optimization across online product portfolios. Take The Very Group (TVG), for example. TVG, a leading multi-brand online retailer in UK, offers customers access to thousands of products—across categories such as clothing, homeware, and electronics—through its popular ecommerce websites. It transformed its product-development process by developing a generative AI system to bolster TVG development. The system uses Amazon Bedrock, LLMs, and multi-modal models to analyze products and create content for TVG copywriters. This improved productivity by condensing development-processing times and increasing the quality of product descriptions. Empowering customer service Retailers are also striving to improve the customer experience both online and in stores. In a 2021 Qualtrics survey, 80 percent of customer respondents said they’ve switched brands because of a poor customer experience. Behind the scenes, AI-powered chatbots and customer service solutions are redefining personalized consumer interactions. With Amazon Web Services (AWS) contact center solutions, organizations can use chatbots to assist web customers almost instantly, improving customer satisfaction while reducing operational costs. And with Amazon Q in Connect, a generative AI assistant suggests agent responses and actions to address customer questions, providing faster issue resolution and improved customer experience. As Brian Dick, Senior Manager of Customer Care at Orbit Irrigation, said, “To resolve customers’ questions, our agents spend two to three minutes per interaction searching through several different sources of knowledge…. Amazon Q in Connect will create 10–15-percent time savings on every contact, and the increased number of calls handled every hour is expected to translate directly into costs savings for Orbit.” This personalized approach not only boosts customer satisfaction, but also cultivates loyalty. Another company revitalizing customer service is DoorDash. In early 2024, DoorDash deployed generative AI–powered self-service in its Amazon Connect contact center. DoorDash used generative AI to strengthen its customer support experience, particularly for Dashers, its delivery drivers. Faced with a high volume of requests from consumers, merchants, and Dashers, the company sought to improve its self-service options. DoorDash collaborated with AWS in its Generative AI Innovation Center, developing a voice-operated, self-service contact center solution within two months. Using Amazon Connect and Amazon Lex, DoorDash created an interactive voice response system that has reduced agent transfers by 49 percent. DoorDash also increased first-contact resolution by 12 percent, leading to better CX and $3 million in annual operational savings. However, many calls still required live agent assistance, prompting DoorDash to further enhance self-service capabilities. Since Dashers prefer phone support for quick help while on the road, DoorDash focused on shortening response times. It implemented generative AI through Amazon Bedrock, which helped answer common questions quickly, improving efficiency and trust in self-service. This initiative not only streamlined support, but also reinforced DoorDash’s commitment to empowering local economies and enhancing CX for its user base of more than 37 million consumers and 2 million Dashers.

I examine how retailers can build resilient, responsible businesses.Follow AuthorJun 04, 2025, 06:16pm EDTJun 06, 2025, 10:47am EDT AI chat bot conversation using artificial intelligence technology to answer user. Chatbot virtual assistant, generative AI, customer support. Person typing prompt on laptop. Chat interface.gettyGenerative AI is quietly rewriting the rules of brand discovery and consideration. Large Language Models now guide shoppers through every step of the journey—surfacing options, comparing features, and even narrowing choices—often without the consumer noticing. While the share of purchases influenced by these AI “concierges” is still small, it’s growing at a remarkable pace. Brands that learn how to show up in this new, AI-curated path-to-purchase will be best positioned to fill (and widen) the top of the funnel.Accenture’s Consumer Pulse Survey 2025 shows nearly one in ten consumers already rank the technology as their most trusted source of what to buy. And over a third of active users—defined as people using gen AI tools at least weekly for personal and/or professional reasons—consider it “a good friend”. It signals a huge shift in consumer attitudes. But it doesn’t end there. As the technology advances, it’s not only able to advise shoppers, but, increasingly, can carry out tasks on their behalf. This is the true promise of agentic AI. Big picture? From the moment a question is asked of a chat-based assistant to the final decision on a product, Gen AI is taking on the role not only of search engine, but a full-service concierge for the modern shopper. Disruption, yes, but also opportunity For retailers and consumer brands, this is both a challenge and an invitation. Do nothing, and risk being misrepresented—or worse, left out of the conversation altogether. It’s why actively engaging with the consumer LLM ecosystem is non-negotiable.MORE FOR YOUIt’s also important to look beyond the short-term disruption and focus on the deeper revenue opportunity. Accenture’s Consumer Pulse Survey reveals consumers are 1.7 times more likely to accept a higher price point from a brand that delivers emotionally or experientially engaging experiences. The implication is clear: when AI curates experiences that feel personal, relevant, and timely, it opens the door to deeper relationships and greater revenue streams. Becoming discoverableThe ecosystem around Gen AI is already forming. It’s not just the foundational models themselves but also the interfaces, data sources such as product catalogs and customer reviews, and partnerships that define how a brand shows up in AI-mediated interactions. For example, when a customer asks, “What’s the best moisturizer for sensitive skin under $50?” AI’s response is not only shaped by historical information from the public internet but increasingly live product data—specifications, ratings, availability, and even brand sentiment. As consumers increasingly think of LLMs as trusted personal shoppers, brands must reimagine their digital strategy. This means allowing the LLM ecosystem to find you in terms of products, inventory, and even prices. Gone are the days of locking down your digital website to not allowing ‘scraping’ if you want to be recommended and served up by these shopping agents.Get it right and your brand becomes not just discoverable but recommended. Not just included but prioritized. Welcome to the Recommendation EraSearch is giving way to suggestion. Retailers now have the opportunity to embed branded, AI-powered advisors directly into their own channels. Instead of forcing shoppers to hunt for SKUs on your website, invite them to ask real questions: “what should I wear to a summer wedding?” or “which after-school snack is the healthiest for my kids?”Gen AI can listen, reason with your product and customer data, and deliver tailored answers in seconds. Curating these conversational experiences today will define how customers discover, trust, and buy from you tomorrow.Gen AI-powered store staffAmid all the excitement around digital commerce, it’s important not to overlook another of gen AI’s profound impacts: the in-store experience. Armed with AI copilots, retail associates can now spend less time on repetitive tasks—inventory checks, scheduling, and so on—and more time engaging customers. In this way, LLM-powered automation isn’t just about driving efficiency. It’s about elevating empathy. And strengthening job satisfaction. When store staff have instant access to product knowledge, customer preferences, and contextual prompts, they become more effective. They can turn their stores into curated, personalized, consultative sales channels; more showroom, less storeroom. It’s a win-win for employees and consumers alike.

    "extractedText": "Aunique shopping experience is a value that every online store manager should bear in mind in order to keep customers and constantly increase conversions. Various forms of personalization are used in many industries for numerous purposes: starting from marketing through streaming services to eCommerce. The main role of personalization in an online store in the year 2021 is to boost sales and improve the user experience (UX). It also works as a great way to engage undecided customers, reduce the number of abandoned shopping carts or increase the number of transactions among first-time store visitors. In other words - a modern store is a personalized store. Personalization vs Customization At the very beginning, we need to distinguish between two terms: personalization and customization. In Polish, both terms are translated as the personalization, although the basic principle behind these solutions is completely different. Customization - the user is able to individually choose the options, which have been designed to provide a more personal shopping experience. For example, users who visit the store's website for the first time may be asked what category of products they are interested in so that the offer may be adopted to their individual choices. Personalization - The system decides what content or offers are displayed on the page. The selection of the message is made automatically, based on the history of the user's behavior. This is possible thanks to artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technology, which, together with the information collected about purchasing preferences from previous sessions, is able to select personalized content in real time. In this article, we will focus on the latter solution, i.e. personalization AI/ML.Real-time personalization of eCommerce sites Increasing number of online stores pay more attention to building a good user experience (UX) on the website. A properly tailored offer is a quick way to finalize the transaction, so it is recommended to make sure that the shopping path is personalized at every stage.eCommerce personalization is precisely the process of providing a unique experience in an online store thanks to dynamic content, product recommendations and special offers generated on the basis of behavior, purchase history and other data referred to below. According to a study by Bloomreach, online stores see about 20% increase in sales after the introduction of personalized content. At the same time, as many as 80% of customers are more likely to make purchases in an online store that uses some form of personalization, and 77% of consumers would recommend a brand that provides a personalized shopping experience. It is also an efficient way to build and maintain a long-lasting relationship with customers - according to the same study, as many as 44% of consumers declare that after shopping in a store where personalization is applied, they are more likely to become regular customers.How AI / ML technology supports online store personalization The introduction of personalization based on AI / ML technology may seem like a complicated process that requires the involvement of IT specialists and a high-cost investment. You might think that this is an option reserved exclusively for the largest online stores. Nothing could be more wrong! Effective and easy-to-install solutions are appearing on the market, available for every store with equally advanced online shopping personalization options. If you are wondering how it is possible that when a 45-year-old woman visits a clothing store, she sees different content and an offer on the homepage than a 25-year-old man visiting the same store? It is the real-time personalization that is responsible for this.It is possible thanks to the information collected by cookies. Thanks to cookies, the content of websites is tailored to the user's preferences and individual needs. Important! Cookies used for personalization do not collect personal data. The data analyzed by the AI system does not make it possible to identify users. In order to create personalized content, the collected data should be immediately segmented into categories such as:Demographic data (age, gender, education, etc.), Interests, User behavior on various channels (websites, mobile devices, social media, email and others), History of previously viewed pages in the store, Purchase history in the store, Geolocation (country, city, province), Time (hour, day of the week, day of the month, season of the year).Thanks to the appropriate segmentation, the offers on the store's website can be tailored to a specific user depending even on the time of day. Personalized content on the store's website informing about, for example, a current promotion or sale, may appear in various forms. The most popular formats are: banners, pop-ups, inline content, surveys / forms, infobars. However, when creating content you should not forget about the specific context the t",

Today’s personalization engines predict, adapt, and learn in real time, create product sets, search results, and offers for every individual. For founders, this shift is both powerful and dangerous: done right, it lifts revenue and retention; done poorly, it creates data chaos, redundant tools, and mounting costs.Before you switch on any AI system, get the groundwork right. The five steps ahead: covering clear goals, reliable data, privacy, technology choices, and team setup, will help you build personalization that works and delivers real results.Industry & Technology OverviewAI-powered personalization has become a core part of e-commerce growth. In 2025, 89% of business leaders call it critical to their success. The rise of hyper-personalization, which uses real-time data and AI to tailor every interaction, is what sets leading brands apart.How AI Personalization WorksEvery time a shopper clicks, scrolls, or lingers on a product, AI is quietly taking notes. These tiny signals combine into a live profile that helps predict what each person wants next. Modern personalization engines turn that data into instant decisions, reshaping pages, offers, and emails in milliseconds. It feels almost human, but it’s powered entirely by data and machine learning.Data Collection & SignalsPersonalization starts with data. Every click, scroll, or cart action becomes a signal that feeds into a real-time behavioral log. The system groups these signals into patterns, learning what each shopper is interested in at that moment. Combined with context such as location and time of day, this forms a live profile that evolves with every interaction.Imagine a shopper hovering over a camera lens for three seconds; that dwell time becomes a clue in the system’s mind.A user adds a T-shirt to their cart but pauses — the next banner they see might show matching sneakers or a checkout incentive.Device type, geolocation, and time of day all layer meaning onto each action, helping the system understand what “interest” truly means.In short, signals turn raw actions into insight. The richness and freshness of those signals are what separate guesswork from relevance. When done right, personalization feels intuitive rather than intrusive.Feature Engineering & User ModelingOnce data is collected, AI needs to understand what it represents. That’s where feature engineering and user modeling come in. These processes convert raw behavior into structured insights the system can learn from.Every event — a product view, click, or purchase — is turned into a set of numerical values known as embeddings.A user embedding summarizes what a shopper currently cares about, such as preferred categories, price range, or style.An item embedding captures product attributes: brand, color, size, popularity, or even tone of customer reviews.The personalization model continuously compares these two vectors to estimate how strong the connection is essentially predicting how likely this shopper is to interact with or buy this product next.Modern systems go further by incorporating:Time patterns, like morning vs. evening browsing habits.Semantic data from product descriptions or images.Session-based learning that distinguishes short-term intent from long-term preference.Press enter or click to view image in full sizeTogether, these signals make the model more context-aware and adaptive. As users interact, embeddings shift to reflect evolving interests ensuring recommendations stay timely and relevant.Quick tip: focus on data quality, not quantity. A compact, frequently refreshed set of behavioral and product features often outperforms massive but outdated datasets.Model Training and Learning LoopsOnce the data and features are ready, the system begins to learn from them. The first stage is usually simple: algorithms look for patterns among shoppers and products to infer what might appeal to each person.Learning from similarityEarly personalization engines use collaborative filtering — a technique that finds overlaps in user behavior. If two people purchase similar items, the system infers they may share interests and recommends accordingly. This approach builds the foundation for those familiar “customers also bought” experiences.2.

We might be able to imagine this work in a store with salespeople. But as organizations scale and customer interactions happen across digital and in-person mediums, their data grows. E-commerce must lean on the latest in machine learning and artificial intelligence to deliver a personalized sales experience. That means relying on a powerful search box.Let’s take a look at how Elastic’s machine learning for search capabilities are powering this kind of e-commerce personalization. But first, let’s talk about what’s at stake. What is e-commerce personalization and why is it important?E-commerce personalization is when a seller delivers an online customer experience that provides individualized suggestions based on a customer’s intent, demographics, previous purchases, context (for example, device type and location), and browsing history. It can also include targeting offers based on behaviors and connecting with customers at key moments. This type of shopping experience is not only convenient—customers are also starting to demand it. According to recent research by McKinsey:71% of customers expect a personalized shopping experience and 76% are frustrated when a company fails to deliver it.Companies that prioritize personalization grow 40% faster than those that don’t. 78% of customers say that they’re more likely to recommend a company to a friend and return to that company for repurchase after receiving a personalized shopping experience. How HappyFresh handled the pandemic ecommerce surge with help from Elastic.How a search box enabled by machine learning can power e-commerce personalizationEvery time someone types something into your search box, you have the opportunity to learn something about them. With machine learning, that information can be put to use for the mutual benefit of your company and the customer. The key is ensuring that your data, whether it’s stored on-premise, in the cloud, or across multiple cloud environments, can be accessed and processed quickly and efficiently. Here are some ways Elastic can help create exceptional personalized shopping experiences for your customers. 1. Pivot ‘failed’ searches into a new and helpful customer journey“No results returned.” Groan. Your customers don’t want to see that message and you certainly don’t want to send it. With machine learning, your search box can auto-suggest options based on related terms or past browsing history (similar to typing something into the Google search box and seeing autofill suggestions.) This turns the interaction from a failed transaction into a “tell me more” conversation. Within a few clicks, you can reorient the customer to the item they were originally seeking. In the process, you’re also creating a customer experience that denotes helpfulness and care. 2. Reduce time-to-purchase through image searches People may be motivated to purchase even before they have all the relevant information to do a targeted search. For example, they may just want to find the gorgeous summer dress they saw on Instagram but may not know a brand name or style.With image search, customers can drill down the precise item they’re looking for without having to weed out endless incorrect search results from non-specific search terms. Instead, the customer can quickly find the brand name and style, prompting a faster opportunity to purchase.A search toolkit for the AI eraThe Elasticsearch Relevance Engine (ESRE) gives developers the tools they need to build AI-powered search apps.Build Generative AI Search Engines and Applications3. Help customers make an informed decisionEvery search can be an opportunity to upsell or cross-sell in a way that provides additional value to the customer. Delivering search returns with additional suggestions tagged “Popular Item” or “Highly Rated” allows shoppers to evaluate different items to make an informed purchase based on their priorities. Maybe they want the lowest-priced item. Maybe they want the item with the most added features. Perhaps there are options they weren’t aware of. Additional results tagged “Frequently bought with this item” goes a step further to allow a shopper to fulfill their entire purpose rather than just making a simple purchase. For example, if they’re going to buy an area rug, they might appreciate a suggestion to purchase carpet tape. 4. Create transparency around product availabilityShould customers buy now or wait?

In the competitive landscape of modern business, adopting AI-driven knowledge management systems has transitioned from a luxury to a fundamental necessity.The incorporation of Large Language Models (LLMs) into business frameworks is becoming an increasingly vital strategy for organizations aiming to stay at the forefront of technological advancement.This integration serves a fundamental role in the existing corporate landscape. The requirement for LLM integration stems from its potential to transform knowledge management processes, encompassing the creation, capture, and organization of information that cannot be efficiently done through traditional approaches.It enables businesses to empower their employees by providing faster access to knowledge. Furthermore, it significantly boosts customer service quality through personalized and efficient interactions. LLMs offer deep data insights which are crucial for informed decision-making and strategy development. In terms of content, they are capable of generating a vast array of materials ranging from reports to creative content, thereby streamlining the content creation workflow.Customizing LLMs for Business NeedsThe customization of LLMs for specific business needs involves techniques such as prompt engineering, finetuning, retrieval augment generation (RAG), and integration of knowledge graphs (KGs) into LLMs, allowing these models to be tailored to specific industry requirements. Since pre-training a large language model requires massive datasets and extensive computing resources, it is beyond the capabilities of most businesses. However, businesses can finetune the foundation models on their specific datasets to turn them into domain-specific LLMs.Pre-training vs. finetuning. Most businesses cannot afford to train their own large language model. Although finetuning is an option for creating domain-specific LLMs, it requires additional expertise and constant finetuning for new data. Image by author.Prompt engineering is the most basic approach that companies can adopt for LLM integration. This approach requires crafting the most appropriate prompt (or a chain of prompts) along with a context that represents the company’s data, style, format, role, examples, and/or limitations. This approach can suffice for most business tasks; however, it is limited by the context size of LLMs. Although current LLMs have a very large context window, business data can exceed the context window. In addition, using a very large context is an expensive and inefficient approach.Press enter or click to view image in full sizePrompt engineering: It’s all about crafting prompt(s) and setting the right context. However, a very large context is not only expensive but is also inefficient. Image by author.Retrieval Augment Generation (RAG) is a more practical approach in which the business data is stored in a specialized database, called a vector database. The data in the vector database is stored in the form of chunks (vectors), with semantically similar chunks placed adjacent to each other. The user query is matched with the vector database to fetch the top semantically similar chunks. These chunks are then sent to the LLM along with the prompt. The LLM picks the most suitable chunk in the context of the prompt and produces the final output.Press enter or click to view image in full sizeRetrieval Augment Generation (RAG) — a more practical approach to integrate business data into LLMs and mitigate hallucinations.

With the advent of Large Foundational Models (LFMs) such as those offered by OpenAI, Microsoft Azure OpenAI, Google Vertex AI, and Meta LLama2, the capabilities of AI in identifying and enhancing customer engagement have significantly increased. Enterprise LLM as a Service + Demo Table of Contents Why LLM Strategy is Important 6 Key Consideration Factors for Integration Build vs But vs Both Dilemma Building LLM Buying LLM Buying and Building Combination Conclusion Additional Resources However, harnessing these technologies is not without challenges, especially when it comes to fine-tuning LLMs with custom data, integrating with enterprise systems, and providing a seamless user experience (UX) across different channels. 6 Key Consideration Factors for Large Language Model Integration Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into business or technological frameworks involves nuanced considerations, particularly from a data science perspective. Here’s an in-depth analysis of the key factors: 1- Cost The financial aspect of LLM integration is a complex equation. It’s not just about the initial investment in either building or buying a model. You have to consider the long-term costs associated with maintenance, updates, and potential scaling. For a custom-built model, the costs include data collection, processing, and the computational power necessary for training. On the other hand, a pre-built LLM may come with subscription fees or usage costs. 2- Large Language Models Fine-Tuning Conundrum Delving into the world of LLMs introduces us to a collection of intricate architectures capable of understanding and generating human-like text. The ability of these models to absorb and process information on an extensive scale is undeniably impressive. However, enterprises and companies seeking to employ these models for bespoke virtual assistants are quickly confronted with a nontrivial challenge: fine-tuning. Fine-tuning an LLM with customer-specific data is a complex task like LLM evaluation that requires deep technical expertise. It is not merely about feeding the model with data; rather, it involves curating the right datasets that represent the brand’s voice, understanding the nuances of various customer segments, and establishing relevance by teaching the model to prioritize customer privacy and data security. The intricacy of fine-tuning lies in adjusting the model’s parameters so that it can grasp and adhere to a company’s unique terminology, policies, and procedures. Such specificity is not only necessary for maintaining brand consistency but is also essential for ensuring accurate, relevant, and compliant responses to user inquiries. 3- Control Developing an LLM from scratch provides unparalleled control over its design, functionality, and the data it’s trained on. This control is critical for applications where specific behaviors or outputs are required. However, this comes with the responsibility of managing and updating the model, which requires a dedicated team of data scientists and ML engineers. 4- Compatibility with Existing Infrastructure The integration of an LLM should complement and enhance existing systems. This involves ensuring compatibility with current data formats, software, and hardware infrastructures. For organizations with advanced data processing and storage facilities, building a custom LLM might be more feasible. Conversely, smaller organizations might lean towards pre-trained models that require less technical infrastructure. 5- Customizability The extent to which an LLM can be tailored to fit specific needs is a significant consideration. Custom-built models typically offer high levels of customization, allowing organizations to incorporate unique features and capabilities. Pre-trained models, while less flexible, are evolving to offer more customization options through APIs and modular frameworks. 6- Security Security is a paramount concern, especially when dealing with sensitive or proprietary data. Custom-built models require robust security protocols throughout the data lifecycle, from collection to processing and storage. Pre-trained models may offer built-in security features, but it’s crucial to assess their adequacy for your specific data privacy and security requirements. This is where the concept of an LLM Gateway becomes pivotal, serving as a strategic checkpoint to ensure both types of models align with the organization’s security standards. Each of these factors requires a careful balance between technical capabilities, financial feasibility, and strategic alignment. The choice between building, buying, or combining both approaches for LLM integration depends on the specific c",

Step 1: Choosing the Right LLMGood news—you don’t need to build and train an LLM from scratch. Instead, you can use one that already exists (and there’s a wide range available). From GPT models to BERT variants, each has its own strengths and is built to specific use cases.That’s why your choice matters so much. If you were hanging a picture on your wall and you had a hammer and wrench in front of you, which would you choose? While both are useful, one is the right tool for this particular job. It’s the same with different LLMsYou want to find one that’s been trained to efficiently execute the tasks you have in mind.The first decision to make is simple: use a managed service or host your own.Managed services make it very easy to get up to speed, interacting with an API. Companies including OpenAI and Anthropic expose their LLMs through accessible APIs. Hyperscalers also offer LLM marketplaces, such as GCP’s ModelGarden, and managed LLM services, such as Amazon Q.But managed services aren’t always the best option –commercially, the unit economics of consuming hosted models may not be feasible;functionally, the performance of a hosted model may fall short for your specific use-case;security-wise, the transfer of code or data to a third-party service can be prohibitive in highly regulated or competitive industries.If you decide you are looking to host your own, your first stop should be the Hugging Face Repository. That’s where our HatchWorks developers always go.It’s a treasure trove of LLMs, complete with filters to ",

A Practical Developer's Guide to LLM Integration Report this article Jason Zakarian Jason Zakarian Published Mar 31, 2025 + Follow After months of experimenting with and researching various AI-assisted development approaches, I've realized: IDE integration does not deliver optimal results for professional development, and agentic or \"vibe-coding\" simply isn't ready for prime time, especially in a large scale, enterprise system. We won't even mention legacy code bases that are so interconnected that there are load bearing comments you can’t delete. Additionally, as we see in so many aspects of life, if we hand off our critical thinking skills to a machine, our own machinery will start to fail. Raise your hand if your sense of direction went south after smart phone map apps? (Ok, mine was never great to begin with). We're starting to see evidence of this with AI usage anecdotally as well as from more scientific sources: https://phys.org/news/2025-01-ai-linked-eroding-critical-skills.html#google_vignette So what should we do instead with these powerful new tools? My Current Strategy: Targeted, Context-Specific Bursts I've found that using powerful LLMs like Claude (Sonnet 3.7), ChatGPT(4o, o3-mini) or (insert your current favorite here) in specific, short bursts with precise context yields the best outcomes. Here's why this approach works: Preserves critical thinking skills - You stay in control of architecture and key decisions and continue to work through logic on your own, only asking for assistance when you choose what is needed. Your mind stays sharp and you can actually speak about the code when questions are asked (questions are always asked). Eliminate boilerplate frustration - No more wasting time on repetitive code or trying to remember what the exact syntax was to do that specific thing with that specific package. This is the perfect type of activity that LLMs can and should replace, which leaves you more free to focus on the big picture, and more creative aspects of the project. Think about learning history - there’s a difference between memorizing when an event took place and knowing WHY it happened. The former is far less valuable than the latter. Maintains developer agency - You determine exactly what context to provide. Very rarely is the code directly above or below where you are working going to be truly helpful in solving complex problems. It's possible that other open files might be helpful, but it's also just as likely that there are bad patterns or incomplete solutions that you would rather the LLM NOT copy. When usage is targeted, you decide what snippets are important and what examples you want to follow, which will always produce better results. Why This Approach Succeeds Where Others Fail Research suggests that effective LLM integration requires breaking tasks into smaller, well-defined components rather than attempting to generate entire solutions at once. As one source noted, \"LLMs work best with a defined structure... Following an organized approach helps generate working code without prompting the LLM to re-correct the generated code multiple times.\" The big idea: LLMs work best as targeted accelerators rather than complete replacements for developer expertise. This follows a historical pattern we've seen with transformative technologies: Afterall, the mechanical loom didn't replace textile artisans but amplified their creativity while handling repetitive pattern work, CAD software empowered architects rather than replacing their design sensibilities, and the calculator freed mathematicians from arithmetic to focus on higher-level problem-solving. That's not to say the same worries we have today didn't get raised back then. Calculator protests from the late 80's.

Now to the nuts and bolts: Practical Implementation Tips There are many versions of this advice now that you can find, so allow me to reinforce the most salient parts from my own experience: Craft specific, bounded prompts with clear expectations. At a high level you must make sure that you define: The goal of the conversation, Reasons why you are attempting this goal, Constraints on the goal (do this, not that), Context related to the goal (mockups, examples of output, desired format), and Personal details which might impact the response (A senior developer might need different responses than a non-technical manager) Here's a great short example from Greg Brockman, president of OpenAI, which illustrates this ",

    "extractedText": "In recent years, a large boom has occurred in the variety and versatility of large language models. These components of AI tools come in different shapes and sizes, allowing businesses to handle many daily tasks. LLMs are a common component of many AI-based products in e-commerce, healthcare, education, and financial sectors.The increasing popularity of these tools leads many companies to consider LLM integration strategies. While the need for large language models is ever-increasing, only a few enterprises fully grasp the technology behind them or how successful implementation puts them at an advantage. What are Large Language Models?LLMs are advanced ML models that understand and produce human language. We have already discussed in our blog: what is LLM and how it works, so today we will talk about the necessity of LLM in today’s business operations. LLMs use vast amounts of text information to find patterns and comprehend language structures to achieve this.Currently, there are two main types of LLMs: closed-source, like GPT, and open-source - such as LLama 2. They come in different dataset sizes and encompass vast volumes of information scraped from the web. Some are pre-trained in specific knowledge to offer better assistance in sensitive fields such as finances and healthcare.However, businesses often turn to AI programmers capable of fine-tuning LLMs to make the tools answer specific questions. Large language models are usually integrated into products like AI chatbots, AI assistants, recommendation systems, and others. Many companies even add them to recruitment and training systems to better identify and onboard candidates.Latest LLM StatisticsLarge language models integration profoundly affected the business world in 2023. The latest statistics show how they improved the daily operations of enterprises in different sectors of the economy:By the end of 2023, the global market for LLMs reached $4,35 billion. Between 2024 and 2030, it’s expected to grow at a 35,9% CAGR. These statistics show that over 300 million companies globally won't lose interest in this technology this year.Why Do Companies Integrate LLMs?One of the main reasons for the success and adoption rates of LLM products is the fact that it’s a new type of technology that has already made waves in various industries. They experience particular popularity among enterprises working with commercial clients. Large language models open a new age of automation and productivity for companies.Despite the novelty of these products, many companies already use them for various internal and external processes. These include Amazon, Facebook, Google, IBM, and Microsoft. In addition to big names, LLMs are a common component in conversational tools smaller companies use for customer support.According to the latest statistics, 23% of worldwide companies plan to deploy commercial LLMs or have already done so. Moreover, 58% of enterprises experiment with working with LLMs. Most likely, the integration rates will increase this year. LLM products are more robust and safer than ever, and with the wide availability of tools, enterprises will be more open-minded about this process. Main Benefits Of LLM IntegrationLarge language models aren’t just a gimmick that helps chatbots produce more accurate responses. Integrating them into business processes has several benefits for businesses of all sizes and industries.Better decision-making. These advanced systems allow companies to make more informed decisions. They accomplish this by analyzing complex scenarios and datasets and summarizing their findings.Deep insights. LLMs help enterprises discover trends and patterns invisible to the human eye. Companies use these insights to create more versatile products, marketing campaigns, and new revenue streams.Higher efficiency and productivity. Modern large language models help companies handle many mundane tasks, such as writing emails, analyzing information, or making reports. This frees up human resources for more complicated tasks.Improved customer relations. These components drastically improve client retention and growth by offering timely support and instant responses. That’s why many companies add them to chatbots and virtual helpers.Lower risks. With large language models integration, companies reduce potential legal, regulation, and compliance risks. Their powerful algorithms allow solutions to spot fraud and suspicious activities.Personalized client approach. LLMs offer a productive and focused way to provide a tailored buying experience for all customers. This approach increases satisfaction and loyalty levels with the potential to raise sales.Saved costs. Task automation using LLMs allows businesses to save funds in different areas and significantly reduce their staff. This makes enterprises more competitive and cost-efficient without hindering the quality of their daily operations. How To Integrate LLMs: A Step-By-Step GuideAttempting LLM implementation ca",

By Ben Rand on May 27, 2025.An analysis of more than 250,000 chat conversations reveals the potential for AI chatbots to improve customer service. Research by Shunyuan Zhang and Das Narayandas.HBSWorking KnowledgeWhen AI Chatbots Help People Act More HumanCan an AI chatbot help customer service representatives, well, be more human? Maybe so, suggests a new study that adds to a chorus of findings on how businesses can best tap the new technology.Researchers at Harvard Business School analyzed a year’s worth of online chat conversations between a meal delivery company and its customers to determine how AI affects response times and customer service. According to their study, AI helped human agents respond to chats some 20 percent faster—improving performance even more for less experienced agents. And, the technology helped humans reply with more empathy and thoroughness—uniquely human service strengths with the potential to positively impact revenue and profitability by making for happier customers.You should not use AI as a one-size-fits-all solution in your business, even when you are thinking about a very specific context such as customer service.Companies from banks to boutiques have been turning to chatbots, hoping that AI can provide faster, cheaper, and more accessible service. However, recent findings point to a growing understanding that AI currently works best as a complement to human intelligence, rather than a replacement. Although AI iterates and improves rapidly, concerns about biased large language models and misleading results suggest that leaders might need to proceed cautiously.“You should not use AI as a one-size-fits-all solution in your business, even when you are thinking about a very specific context such as customer service,” says HBS Assistant Professor Shunyuan Zhang. “As the paper shows, there are boundaries, and the effects of AI vary across different customer intents.”Zhang worked with Das Narayandas, the Edsel Bryant Ford Professor of Business Administration at HBS, on “Engaging Customers with AI in Online Chats: Evidence from a Randomized Field Experiment,” which is forthcoming in Management Science.How AI improves customer serviceThe study focused on the delivery company’s use of an agent-based support AI tool developed by Loris.ai, a New York-based firm that aims to make customer service more human. Some agents received real-time response suggestions from the AI tool, while others did not.The tool began as an AI crisis hotline designed to manage difficult conversations with empathy and appropriate suggestions. It was trained on a database of more than 3 million diverse customer-service situations to recommend responses with four basic steps: an offer to help, an apology, a validation formula, and gratitude.The researchers designed an experiment involving 138 customer service agents at an unnamed meal delivery company. They analyzed 256,934 online chat conversations between December 2020 and November 2021 for efficiency and customer sentiment. Customer sentiment was evaluated by the AI tool based on emotional tone at the beginning and end of the interaction. Agents who used AI-based suggestions experienced:22%Drop in response times, even as agent-customer interactions increased0.45 ptsIncrease in customer sentiment on a five-point scale, compared with agents without AIAmong less-experienced agents, the results were more pronounced: 70%Decline in response time1.63 ptsIncrease in customer sentimentWhen AI works best—and when it doesn’tWhile AI assistance generally led to improved customer sentiment, some types of inquiries showed more benefit than others.The study found that AI improved sentiment when customers asked to cancel their subscriptions. The researchers think this could be because AI recommended alternative subscription options. However, the improvement was less substantial when customers contacted the company with repeat complaints, which suggests that these matters transcended AI’s capabilities.When customers were transferred to human agents after their initial engagement with AI chatbots, the technology responded so fast that some customers felt confused. In those cases, customer sentiment scores improved less—most likely, the authors say, because the transfer happened so quickly that customers thought they were still communicating with a chatbot.“AI helped agents respond to customers more rapidly, which is a good thing,” Zhang says. “But when it’s too fast, customers kind of wonder, ‘is this still AI?’” New ways to harness AIManagers implementing AI tools for employees should focus on the question of “who would benefit more?” Zhang says. The research suggests that AI is effective for:Training new employees in service rolesPerhaps most significantly, the researchers discovered that AI support helped less-experienced agents most.

The numbers tell a sobering story: 73% of consumers use multiple channels before making a purchase, but retail businesses miss the mark on when personalization actually matters. While 66% of companies target first-time visitors with personalized offers, only 38% of consumers want personalization at that early stage.Here's where it gets worse. Despite 85% of organizations increasing their investments in AI in retail last year, only 6% saw payback within twelve months. Three-quarters can't even demonstrate measurable ROI from their digital investments.So how do you bridge the gap between AI investment and actual performance? You start with strategy, not software. You fix your data foundation — focusing on the data integration process — before you build algorithms on top of it. And you focus on decisions that drive margin, not just efficiency metrics that look good in presentations.A Closer Look at Data in RetailThe problem runs deeper than technology. Over 50% of companies point to legacy system integration as their biggest barrier to adopting AI analytics. When consumers shop across three or more digital channels monthly and 32% will abandon beloved brands after one bad experience, fragmented customer data becomes a business-killing weakness.The Analytics-as-a-Service market will grow from $13.3 billion in 2024 to $39.8 billion by 2029. But growth doesn't guarantee results. The truth is, most retailers approach retail AI backwards: they buy technology first to only then wonder why it doesn't work. This creates expensive experiments instead of business value.The ROI Gap in AI and Data Analytics in RetailHere's the uncomfortable truth: 95% of organizations see minimal ROI from their AI investments, and 80% of companies using AI have yet to realize meaningful bottom-line results. That's not a technology problem. It's a strategy problem involving how they handle retail data.Why most AI investments underperformThe failures aren't random. They follow predictable patterns:Fragmented data architecture creates the illusion of insight without the foundation for decisions. When retailers operate with disparate data sources, AI becomes expensive guesswork rather than reliable data driven decision making.Misalignment with operations turns sophisticated algorithms into expensive distractions. Research identifies \"brittle workflows, lack of contextual learning, and misalignment with day-to-day operations\" as primary failure factors. If predictive analytics do not fit how people actually work, they simply don't work.Poor implementation reveals itself in the details. 77% of UK e-commerce retailers admit their AI initiatives need work. The biggest disappointments? AI powered chatbots (29%), data analysis applications (27%), and AI-driven marketing (23%) underperforming expectations regarding customer satisfaction.The problem lies in how the strategy is executed. Companies buy analytics tools for problems they haven't properly defined. AI chatbots, when built with care and consideration, can be a significant boost in customer experience.Short-term expectations vs. long-term valueMost executives expect technology investments to deliver returns within 7-12 months. AI retail analytics laughs at that timeline. The average payback period stretches to 2-4 years, with only 6% of organizations reporting payback in under a year.Yet 91% plan to increase their AI spend this year to keep up with market trends. Why? Fear of falling behind competitors drives investment more than clear financial returns. That's a dangerous foundation for informed decisions.The myth of instant personalizationWant to see the ROI gap in action? Look at personalization. 92% of retailers believe they deliver personalized customer experiences, while only 48% of their shoppers agree. That's not a small measurement error. That's a fundamental misunderstanding of customer behavior.The data gets worse. 53% of consumers report seeing no impact from AI powered analytics driving personalization, and 73% prefer human insight over AI-based recommendations.Most organizations chase immediate cost savings through AI implementation instead of focusing on long-term value creation. As one expert puts it: \"Cost reduction has a hard floor while value creation has no ceiling\". This shortsightedness prevents retailers from developing strategies to enhance customer experiences that could deliver exponential growth rather than incremental efficiency gains.What's Blocking AI Success in RetailWhy do well-funded AI projects still fail?

    "extractedText": "With structured data as the foundation, AI enables smarter, faster decision-making across the enterprise. Here’s your guide to future-proof implementation. Retail data is a necessary foundation for CPG operations and decision-making, providing suppliers with crucial visibility into real-time retail and inventory movements across thousands of touchpoints. It’s vital in an age where shopper behavior and product trends are in constant flux. Beyond day-to-day functions, however, the amount of retail data suppliers incur across the omnichannel landscape can be so expansive and granular that it can become overwhelming to analyze and extract meaningful insights from. That could be why AI — known for its efficiency and productivity possibilities — presents such a compelling opportunity for the retail and consumer goods industry, with an estimated potential impact of $400 billion to $660 billion annually; driven by AI-supported strategic growth and cost savings through automation of key functions. This value hasn’t gone unnoticed. Retailers’ investments in AI to realize this value have led to two key developments: consumer technology that personalizes shopping experiences and drives purchase behavior; and new, more robust data infrastructure and reporting solutions to drive supplier success. While the wealth of new data made available by retailers is beneficial, their AI-driven visions also raise the bar for performance, demanding faster response times and fulfillment. AI-powered analytics can accelerate suppliers’ time-to-insight and help them make smarter, faster decisions around demand forecasting, inventory management, and business planning, ensuring the adaptability of their operations. But there’s a learning curve — with over 85% of generative AI projects initiated by companies failing to reach production this year. As we’re beginning to understand, the major roadblock is underdeveloped data that fails to meet the intricate, highly granular requirements of large language models (LLMs) and other similar foundation models. While AI promises extreme automation and industry transformation, thoughtfully structured data is essential for the accurate and integrated use of AI tools in retail analytics. In this article, we uncover how to harness retail data for fast, reliable, and powerful AI-powered insights and offer clear paths that organizations can take to begin realizing enterprise-wide value today. The major roadblock [in generative AI project project production] is underdeveloped data that fails to meet the intricate, highly granular requirements of large language models (LLMs) and other similar foundation models. Data as the foundation For CPG suppliers, retail data sources span retailers and distributors of all types, each with their own disparate nomenclature and structure. Millions of records of highly granular data that tracks inventory and sales from distribution centers through to individual consumer purchases at the store level are generated every day. Crisp’s data platform ingests, normalizes, and harmonizes this data from multiple sources, creating a unified foundation for analytics and decision-making. However, suppliers need to take data preparedness a step further to leverage AI’s power in retail analytics. This is where a semantic layer comes in, building consistent, natural business language around disparate data sources, and enriching it with logic and context tailored to the nuances of a unique industry. The semantic layer adds crucial meaning and context to normalized data. This is because while a generative AI model might recognize terms like ‘Dollar Velocity’ or ‘Share of Category YoY Growth,’ it needs to have the understanding of their precise definitions and business context to contribute actionable insights. The semantic layer explicitly defines these metrics, establishes their relationships, and encodes the underlying business logic, empowering CPG teams to draw insights that seamlessly inform inventory management, merchandising, growth strategies, and more. Recognizing this need, Crisp has created the first semantic layer specifically for the retail industry. This added embedded technology provides the context necessary to transform collective retail data sources into natural language queryable information. It can be utilized across departments for fast, reliable insights regardless of technical expertise, heralding a major unlock in AI-driven efficiency. While a generative AI model might recognize terms like ‘Dollar Velocity’ or ‘Share of Category YoY Growth,’ it needs to have the understanding of their precise definitions and business context to contribute actionable insights. The semantic layer explicitly defines these metrics, establishes their relationships, and encodes necessary underlying business logic. Interacting with intelligence With a robust data foundation in place, what comes next? How can businesses leverage AI-ready retail data for even faster, more thoughtful decision-",

It’s a family of models, each with different strengths.Some are built for speed. Some are optimized for deep reasoning. Some handle massive amounts of context.But with so many versions—GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4o—it’s easy to lose track of what’s what.That’s why we’re breaking it all down.In this guide, we’ll go model by model, explaining what each of the major OpenAI model does best.GPT-4GPT-4 was one of the most anticipated AI releases of 2023. After the groundbreaking impact of GPT-3 and GPT-3.5, the world was waiting for OpenAI’s next major leap. Speculation ran wild—would GPT-4 be AGI? Would it be 100x smarter than GPT-3? Would it completely revolutionize AI applications?When OpenAI finally launched GPT-4 on March 14, 2023, it didn’t come with an AGI breakthrough—but it was a significant step forward. It introduced better reasoning, enhanced accuracy, and multimodal capabilities (the ability to understand both text and images). It wasn’t just “bigger,” it was smarter and more reliable.However, there was one downside: it was expensive and slower compared to GPT-3.5. OpenAI focused on quality over cost, which meant GPT-4 was primarily used for high-end applications rather than everyday AI tasks.What OpenAI Thinks About GPT-4OpenAI positioned GPT-4 as a major refinement of AI intelligence. According to OpenAI:It’s far more accurate than GPT-3.5, reducing hallucinations and misinformation.It has improved logical reasoning and is better at handling complex tasks.It’s multimodal, meaning it can process both text and images (though the image input feature was limited to certain applications).It’s more aligned with human values and safety, making it less likely to generate harmful content.Essentially, GPT-4 was a thinking AI, not just a talking one.Strengths of GPT-4Better at following instructions – More nuanced, context-aware, and reliable.Higher reasoning capabilities – Can process complex queries with greater accuracy.Multimodal abilities – Can interpret and generate text and understand images.Safer AI interactions – Improved content moderation and ethical safeguards.Release TimelineMarch 14, 2023 – OpenAI officially launched GPT-4 for ChatGPT Plus users and API access.July 2023 – OpenAI expanded API availability to more developers.API Pricing for GPT-4GPT-4 was more expensive than GPT-3.5, making it suitable for high-end applications. Here’s the API pricing:Input tokens: $0.03 per 1,000 tokensOutput tokens: $0.06 per 1,000 tokensDue to these costs, many developers used GPT-4 selectively for critical tasks while relying on GPT-3.5 for cheaper, high-volume operations.What You Can Build With GPT-4 (Using the API)GPT-4’s intelligence and reasoning made it ideal for:Legal and financial AI tools – More precise contract analysis, financial forecasting, and compliance automation.Advanced AI tutors – Personalized education tools for complex subjects like mathematics and coding.AI for research & data analysis – Assisting in scientific research and business intelligence.Medical AI applications – Assisting with diagnosis, summarizing medical literature, and patient interactions.Creative AI – Generating scripts, poetry, and deep storytelling content.GPT-4 TurboGPT-4 Turbo arrived at a time of uncertainty in the AI world. OpenAI had already released GPT-4, which was widely seen as a gold standard for general AI performance. Yet, competitors like Anthropic (Claude), Google DeepMind (Gemini), and Mistral were gaining ground, offering powerful alternatives with different cost and speed trade-offs.Users were expecting GPT-5, but OpenAI took a different approach—rather than rushing a completely new version, they focused on optimization. The goal? Make GPT-4 significantly cheaper, faster, and more scalable.Sam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO, positioned GPT-4 Turbo as the “smarter” way forward—instead of just pushing a raw intelligence upgrade, OpenAI fine-tuned the model to deliver similar or better performance at a fraction of the cost. It was a move that catered to developers, businesses, and AI-powered applications that needed to scale without skyrocketing expenses.What OpenAI Thinks About GPT-4 TurboOpenAI describes GPT-4 Turbo as a high-efficiency AI model that balances intelligence, speed, and affordability. According to OpenAI, it’s:Faster and cheaper than standard GPT-4, making it the best option for API-based applications.Still as powerful as GPT-4, with slight improvements in reasoning and cost efficiency.A strategic move to ensure AI remains widely accessible for developers.Essentially, G",

    "extractedText": "GPT Image-1.5 and AI Generators: Business Applications in 2025 Ryan Bradshaw December 17, 2025 AI image generators have moved from experimental tools to essential business infrastructure in 2025. They turn simple text prompts into detailed visuals, reshaping how teams plan, design, test, and launch ideas. Instead of waiting days for design revisions, businesses now get usable images in minutes, drastically speeding up decision-making and execution. E-commerce Visuals and Virtual Try-Ons with GPT-Image-1.5 For e-commerce brands, an AI image generator replaces many stages of traditional product photography. A single text prompt can create product mockups, lifestyle shots, and banner images tailored to different audiences, helping small and medium businesses compete visually without heavy investment in studios, models, or repeated photoshoots. Instead of coordinating photographers, stylists, and location rentals, online sellers can use an AI image generator to produce professional product visuals in minutes, dramatically reducing both time-to-market and production costs. This accessibility allows smaller brands to maintain the same visual quality standards as larger competitors while operating on tighter budgets. Virtual try-ons are another powerful use case like AI face swap. By combining product images with AI-generated or real customer photos, stores can show how clothing, accessories, or beauty products might look on different faces and body types. GPT Image 1.5 excels at preserving critical brand elements such as logos, packaging details, and watermarks during edits, allowing teams to change product colors, adjust backgrounds, or swap accessories while maintaining brand consistency. This granular editing control lets marketers create dozens of product variations without reshooting. Performance Marketing, A/B Testing, and Text-Rich Creatives Marketing teams use AI image generators to build entire creative directions from a few lines of text. GPT-Image-1.5’s improved instruction-following allows marketers to specify exact layouts, compositions, and visual constraints in complex prompts, generating multiple campaign variations instantly. Instead of briefing a designer and waiting days, teams can generate options, refine the best ones, and involve designers once the visual direction is clear. The model’s 4x faster generation speed supports real-time A/B testing at scale. Marketers can quickly generate dozens of ad variations—changing backgrounds, colors, compositions, and formats—to test what resonates best on social media, landing pages, and email campaigns. GPT-Image-1.5’s advanced text rendering also enables the creation of infographics, promotional graphics with readable callouts, and social posts with accurate typography, reducing reliance on traditional design software for text-heavy creatives. Film, Gaming, and Animation: Concept Art and Consistent Characters In film, gaming, and animation, AI image generators function like an always-available concept artist. Writers and directors can turn script descriptions into concept art, environments, and character ideas without waiting for manual sketches, which is especially useful in early development when ideas change frequently. GPT-Image-1.5’s facial preservation features ensure that character designs remain consistent across multiple scene variations, keeping recognizable features intact even when lighting, poses, or backgrounds change. Character designers use the model’s iterative editing capabilities to refine costumes, adjust expressions, or alter environments while maintaining core character identity. This consistency is crucial for storyboarding, where the same characters must appear across many panels with different actions and settings. Fashion Design, Clothing Swap, and Seasonal Campaign Previews In fashion, AI image generators are used long before a physical garment exists. Designers can test patterns, fabrics, cuts, and colorways on virtual models, tweaking details in seconds instead of sewing multiple prototypes, which reduces waste and speeds up collection development. GPT-Image-1.5’s clothing swap capabilities enable brands to show how garments look on different body types and skin tones while maintaining accurate fabric textures, shadows, and draping. The model can adjust product colors without altering placement, change background lighting without affecting the garment’s appearance, and preserve facial features during virtual try-ons. This level of precision allows fashion marketers to create seasonal preview campaigns with AI-generated scenes and locations before physical samples arrive. Healthcare and Education: Custom Diagrams and Instructional Visuals AI image generators also support non-creative industries such as healthcare and education. Medical teams use GPT-Image-1.5 to create custom anatomy diagrams, step-by-step procedure visuals, and patient education materials with accurate text labels and annotations. These visuals can be adapt",

Using ChatGPT for Computer Vision Tasks7. Your ChatGPT Business Case?The Importance of Prompt Engineering and the Future of GPT Models We will send you an email with the link to the requested file GPT models weren’t widely popular until November 2022, once OpenAI built a successor of their language models called ChatGPT. As for March 2023 ChatGPT is now officially released with an API and SDK to integrate the model into your products. While there are a plethora of applications on the surface, ChatGPT offers a wide range of improvements for different types of technical and business processes. So here we’ll put to the test the most viable, and see where it gets us. I’ll share with you my vision on how we can benefit from GPT models on different levels of automation, while providing you with a concise answer of the question, “What do I need to implement a GPT model in my product?”. Please note: all the tests were made during the pre-release stage. What is ChatGPT and What are GPT Models in General? If you already know what ChatGPT and other GPT models are, you can skip this part. Because here I’ll define ChatGPT from different angles, along with how to exploit its capabilities to dig for data and provide us with necessary information. The easiest way to do this is by simply asking the model, and here is how ChatGPT identifies itself: ChatGPT defines itself ChatGPT is the latest GPT model that was developed on the basis of GPT 3.5. It has the ability to interact with the user in the form of a dialogue and provide answers to almost any question based on events and information up until 2021. GPT models are highly capable of solving a range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks with the possibility of customization such as: Keywords extraction Text translation Question answering Text generation Text summary Spelling correction Text style transferring Named entity recognition How to Use ChatGPT in Your App or Website As of March 2023, ChatGPT is available via API and some companies like Snapchat are already using it. So it makes sense to discuss how ChatGPT can be integrated in your application for a technical standpoint. There is a certain fork of options here: 1. The task is viable by means of the existing model. Here, the model operates as a smart catalog, helping the user to browse through content and make choices more quickly using the response of GPT. However, customizations and personalization are not available. 2. Fine-tuning the model with your own data. Such models can be useful for creating a personalized chatbot recommender system based on user actions/desires and other use cases. Using your own data, the GPT model can be trained to introduce the element of personalization. The amount of data needed to fine tune a GPT model depends on various factors, such as the size and complexity of the data set, and the desired performance of the model. Typically, at least a few hundred examples are required to effectively fine-tune a GPT model. However, in complex domains, it may take tens of thousands or even millions of examples to achieve optimal model performance. To understand whether you’ll need to fine-tune the model, I would recommend you running through these 5 steps: Business understanding that involves learning the business case, what task is delegated to the model, what data it should use, and the personalization features that are expected. Data gathering. This step can be skipped if personalized information can be skipped at the early stages. But if you plan to use the GPT model in a highly specific domain, by default, the model will fail to operate correctly. Which means, this stage is necessary. For example, it is necessary to recommend clothes for the user based on what is available in the store. Then it is necessary to collect information about the products of the store and provide basic instructions for recommendations (for example, jeans with the article YYYY should be worn over a T-shirt with such XXXX). Data annotation/Data labeling. This stage will include creating a prompt for each sample from the data gathering stage. For example: shorts with YYYY articles must be worn over a T-shirt with XXXX article = what should I wear under a T-shirt with XXX article? And the expected answer: jeans with YYYY article. Data Preparation. This implies converting the data into a suitable format, e.g. “{“prompt”: “<what should I wear under a T-shirt with article XXX?>”, “completion”: “<Shorts with article YYYY>”}”.

Pro tips: HubSpot Sales Hub supports flexible payment processing, making it easy for businesses to implement multiple pricing strategies all within a unified platform that connects to the CRM. Dynamic and token-based pricing capabilities are a part of HubSpot’s robust integrations ecosystem. Pricing Strategies that Work Well for AI Companies AI companies have different pricing considerations than other businesses. In fact, AI pricing strategies need to factor in computational costs, rapid product evolution, and diverse customer needs. However, when picking an AI pricing strategy, most companies choose one of the following approaches: Usage-based pricing. Tiered subscription pricing. Freemium pricing. Value-based pricing. Or a hybrid approach. Usage-Based Pricing Usage-based payment is an AI pricing strategy that charges customers based on how often they use the AI product. That means users are charged per API call, processing time, tokens used, or data analyzed. This approach is popular among AI companies because it aligns costs with value delivery and scales naturally with customer growth. Companies like OpenAI and Anthropic use this approach, making AI accessible to startups while capturing revenue from enterprise-scale usage. Tiered Subscription Pricing Tiered subscription pricing lets AI companies serve different customer segments with a single product. The companies offer multiple tiers (often, Basic, Professional, and Enterprise). Each tier includes specific feature sets, usage limits, or service levels. HubSpot is an example of an AI service that offers tier-based pricing. Starter, Pro, and Enterprise all offer different AI-powered features for a set price. Users are not charged based on how many times they use an AI feature. Tiered subscription pricing provides predictable revenue and helps customers understand exactly what they're getting at each price point.

This paper examines how pricing leaders can improve margin optimization, adjust to shifting market conditions, and optimize pricing strategies by incorporating AI into their daily operations. Learn about the most recent advancements, practical applications, and future possibilities of AI in B2B pricing to help your company stay ahead of the curve.Figure 1: Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Retail Market Size, 2022 - 2032 (USD Billion)Introduction: In the current data-driven and fast-paced market climate, companies are under growing pressure to optimize their pricing strategies. Conventional pricing strategies, which frequently depend on human analysis and historical data, are insufficient to stay competitive. Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming a more potent instrument that helps companies to increase productivity, optimize profitability, and make data-driven pricing decisions. By using cutting-edge algorithms and machine learning models to evaluate enormous volumes of data, spot trends, and suggest the best prices, artificial intelligence (AI) is completely reinventing pricing methods.● Pricing algorithms may boost revenue from 1% to 5% and lengthen the customer life cycle by 20%, according to a comprehensive worldwide assessment carried out by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the BCG Henderson Institute (BHI).● By 2028, it's expected that the retail industry will have invested $24.1 billion in AI-based solutions.●Personalized suggestions, content creation, and predictive analytics are projected to be the top applications of generative AI by global marketers and advertisers in 2023.Analytics and AI for Margin Optimization: AI is essential for improving margin optimization because it gives pricing teams instant access to information about cost structures, market dynamics, and consumer behavior. AI is able to find chances to modify prices in a way that maximizes profit margins while maintaining market share by examining these aspects. AI, for example, can identify underperforming product lines and recommend price adjustments to match competition pricing and market demand. By using a flexible approach, companies may protect their profitability while retaining a competitive advantage. Example: A multinational electronics firm regularly tracked market trends and competition activity using pricing analytics driven by AI. The AI system saw a trend where rivals regularly changed their rates during the busiest times of year for sales. The manufacturer increased its market share and increased its profits by 15% by aggressively adjusting its pricing approach.Figure 2: Benefits of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Retail Business Worldwide, 2022Leveraging AI for Everyday Pricing Operations and New Product Pricing: AI can be used to expedite daily pricing processes in addition to long-term strategic decision-making. Routine operations like pricing monitoring, updating pricing models based on fresh data, and identifying anomalies that need attention can be automated by AI. Pricing teams may now concentrate on more strategic tasks, including introducing new goods or breaking into untapped markets, thanks to this automation. AI can forecast the ideal launch price for new products by examining past sales data, consumer preferences, and industry trends. Businesses can make well-informed decisions that strike a balance between profitability and market acceptance by modeling several price situations. Example: A software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider used AI to optimize subscription service pricing. Artificial Intelligence suggested tiered pricing structures based on the needs of various client categories by examining customer usage habits. This strategy led to 10% more subscription renewals and higher customer satisfaction.2. Use Cases and Best Practices in AI-Powered Pricing from Around the World: Global adoption of AI in a variety of industries demonstrates its adaptability and potency as a pricing strategy. These are a few noteworthy use cases:Figure 3: AI Use Cases in Consumer Goods and Retail Industry Worldwide, 2020Retail: To improve markdown pricing, a top fashion retailer analyzed real-time sales data using artificial intelligence. The retailer raised sales during end-of-season discounts and eliminated surplus inventory by 20% by employing AI-driven markdown methods. Manufacturing: Using AI, a European supplier of auto components dynamically modified prices based on the cost of raw materials and the prices of rival companies. Despite changes in input costs, the company was nevertheless profitable thanks to its flexible pricing strategy.

However, certain pricing algorithms may learn to engage in tacit collusion in competitive scenarios, resulting in overly competitive prices and potentially harmful consequences for consumer welfare. This has prompted policymakers and scholars to emphasize the importance of designing rules to promote competitive behavior in marketplaces.In a new study in Marketing Science, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University investigated the role of product ranking systems on e-commerce platforms in influencing the ability of certain pricing algorithms to charge higher prices. The study’s findings suggest that even absent price discrimination, personalized ranking systems may not benefit consumers.“We examined the effects of personalized and unpersonalized ranking systems on algorithmic pricing outcomes and consumer welfare,” explains Param Vir Singh, Carnegie Bosch Professor of Business Technologies and Marketing and Associate Dean for Research the Tepper School of Business, who coauthored the study.Because of the number of options available, online consumers face a difficult, time-consuming search process. This has led to the emergence of online search intermediaries (e.g., Amazon, Expedia, Yelp), which use algorithms to rank and provide consumers with ordered lists of third-party sellers’ products in response to their queries. These intermediaries reduce search costs and boost consumer welfare by helping consumers find suitable products more efficiently.In this study, researchers examined two extreme scenarios of product ranking systems that differed in how they incorporated consumer information for generating product rankings. The first system, personalized ranking, used detailed consumer information to rank products based on predicted utility for each individual. The second, called unpersonalized ranking, relied solely on aggregate information across the entire population, resulting in an inability to customize the rankings for individual consumers.Researchers used a consumer demand model characterized by search behavior, in which consumers searched sequentially to learn about the utilities they could obtain from various products. In this model, the ranking algorithm suggested by the intermediary affects the order in which consumers evaluate products, with each evaluation incurring a search cost. Consumers engage in optimal search and purchase behavior to maximize their utility. Hence, an intermediary's specific ranking system can steer demand in different ways, which have important implications for pricing outcomes.“We compared these two systems to provide a clear understanding of the pricing implications of personalization in ranking technologies, specifically reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, for AI-powered pricing algorithms,” says Liying Qiu, a Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon’s Tepper School, who led the study.“Studying RL pricing algorithms in the context of realistic consumer behavior models is challenging due to the complexity of the dynamics they create, but by setting up controlled simulated environments, we were able to examine how these algorithms evolve and interact over time experimentally,” notes Yan Huang, Associate Professor of Business Technologies at Carnegie Mellon’s Tepper School, who coauthored the study.Personalized ranking systems, which rank products in decreasing order of consumers’ utilities, may encourage higher prices charged by pricing algorithms, especially when consumers search for products sequentially on a third-party platform. This is because personalized ranking significantly reduces the ranking-mediated price elasticity of demand and thus incentives to lower prices.Conversely, unpersonalized ranking systems lead to significantly lower prices and greater consumer welfare.

In this post, we’ll dive deeper into the use of machine learning in supply chain logistics, explore how machine learning can benefit supply chains, and share tips for how it can improve your supply chain management. What is machine learning in supply chain logistics? Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) technology that uses data and algorithms to identify patterns and make informed decisions. In supply chain logistics, machine learning technology collects large amounts of data from across various supply chain processes. It then analyzes this data to make smart predictions and suggestions for supply chain optimization. Machine learning programs can be used to gather advanced supply chain analytics so you can easily get actionable insights on performance. Machine learning also enables supply chain automation to a significant extent, allowing you to automate things like demand forecasting and route optimization. As such, machine learning is vital for enhancing supply chain efficiency, saving time, and improving your overall performance. The evolution of machine learning in logistics The logistics industry once largely relied on paper-based systems that involved a lot of manual tracking and required implicit, learned knowledge to make effective decisions. When the first enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems were introduced in the late 1980s, they helped streamline and simplify supply chain logistics management. These ERP systems helped to centralize supply chain processes into a single software. However, they weren’t equipped to process vast amounts of data in real time or make decisions that considered all the intricacies of supply chain dynamics. This often led to incomplete insights and inaccurate predictions, which resulted in sub-optimal supply chain decisions. Flash-forward to present day, and businesses can now access technology that’s capable of collecting and analyzing vast amounts of data in real time from across various supply chain processes. The development of advanced machine learning algorithms that perform predictive analytics now help brands make real-time decisions using this data, making it possible for ecommerce businesses to improve supply chain efficiency and oversee their supply chain operations with minimal human oversight. Modern supply chain technology also leverages machine learning to help automate various activities. This includes IoT devices and robotics that leverage machine learning to automate tasks like warehouse monitoring, picking, packing, and inventory tracking. Key benefits of machine learning for supply chains With its ability to analyze massive data sets in real time and speed up decision-making, machine learning can be highly beneficial for supply chains.

    "extractedText": "How Startups Can Use AI in Their Content Strategy Studies reveal that AI adoption has helped businesses increase revenue and improve customer experience by automating tasks and freeing employees to do more meaningful, critical work. Introduction to AI Artificial intelligence (AI) has long been a hot topic. Just last week it was reported that ChatGPT has become the fastest growing user base in history, reaching 100 million monthly users in just two months! Fictional plots in TV, film, and books have infinitely pitted AI against humans. And with the advent of AI tools for output that has traditionally been created by humans, such as art, marketing content, and even (quite controversially) academic writing, the anxiety surrounding AI is quite understandable. However, research on AI technology paints a less grim picture, especially concerning the application of AI to improve business workflows. A recent IBM survey reveals that global AI adoption is growing steadily. Per IBM, 77% of companies are currently exploring AI to some extent, with 35% using AI in their businesses and 42% studying how they can incorporate AI into their workflows. Many businesses have found AI useful in addressing labor gaps by automating repetitive tasks, allowing finite human resources to focus on more intensive pursuits that require high-level critical thinking. Research also shows that AI contributes to a marked increase in revenue. McKinsey reveals that when supplemented with AI adoption, the following business functions correspond to the highest increases in revenue: AI sales tools have proven to be effective in increasing conversion rates and improving customer experiences, especially for online-based businesses. As such, startups venturing into digital content or eCommerce should leverage AI tools to supplement their existing content strategies and automate a wide range of tasks. A brief history of AI in marketing and related fields There’s no doubt about the value of AI in many areas of business, especially in marketing. With such high demand for agile, high-quality content, more and more teams are leveraging the power of AI to fill content gaps, create prompts, and even carry out technical functions such as keyword research and analytics. Google’s continual refinement of its search algorithm has forced many businesses to whip their websites into shape by creating grammatically correct, informative, and engaging content. Back in 1998, Amazon spearheaded the use of AI based on research by Columbia University computational linguist Jussi Karlgren. Amazon used it to develop collaborative filtering, a function that displayed product recommendations based on collected data. Today, the same technology gives us film and TV show suggestions on Netflix and music recommendations on Spotify. AI cross-references consumer data and browsing history with user profile information and demographics to tailor recommendations based on one’s likes and dislikes. In 2013, AI content creation was first used to generate sports articles that could be published almost in real-time. Yahoo! used Automated Insights’ Wordsmith platform to write personal reports, match recaps, and match previews based on fantasy football data. The platform used natural language generation (NLG) to personalize content for each user. Particular care was given to ensure that the AI captured Yahoo’s brand voice and tone. “The tone of the narratives for Yahoo were intentionally snarky and sarcastic, so there was a process to making sure the jokes, language, and stats about each week’s matchup (or the draft reports at the beginning of the season) that are highlighted were what Yahoo was looking for,” Automated Insights spokesperson Laura Pressman shared. Programmatic ad buying boomed in 2014. With AI, digital ads could be bought and sold based on defined campaign goals and a set budget, as AI made decisions and recommendations based on collected data. In 2015, Google’s AI algorithm RankBrain revolutionized the way people consume and create content by considering user intent when returning search results. Take the query “shepherd’s pie” as an example. The search engine would return results for recipes and tutorial videos based on the understanding that the person is likely looking for information on how to prepare it. As such, historical and literary references about shepherd’s pie would be farther down the roster of search engine results pages (SERPs). In 2016, AI progressed to listening and verbally responding, and virtual assistant devices became valuable additions to modern homes. Since then, more mainstream uses for AI content generation have emerged, with apps like Slack, WhatsApp, and Messenger leveraging AI to answer basic customer support questions via chatbots. This feature provides better customer service, lead generation, and user experience. How startups can use AI for content + tools you can use What does using AI in one’s content strategy mean?

Our AI & Machine Learning, Infrastructure 2021 survey includes direct input from 700 AI decision-makers across the US and UK. Diving into this insight reveals many trends and developments in the market, including an ever-increasing adoption rate, a shift toward both the cloud and the edge, and several hurdles that need to be overcome to get AI projects from concept into production. As ever, all these factors vary by industry and, to a certain extent, by country. This report highlights some key findings ahead of our full Advisory Report. Although much of the data that fuels machine learning comes from edge devices of various types, our data shows that ML is increasingly being done in the cloud, and attention is shifting toward tools that complement that scenario. AI infrastructure is seen as something distinct from overall IT infrastructure (be it cloud, on-premises or hybrid), and budgets are set differently and are expected to grow, having been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Production pipelines will become more efficient with time, but right now the disconnect between IT and business users may be slowing things down, as the latter have a harder time getting approval to start projects and play a smaller role in spending and approval decisions. Organizations are becoming more aware of ESG concerns regarding AI and ML, including whether AI is being used for immoral or unethical purposes, the environmental impact of AI, and government regulation of the sector – the last of which is higher in the US than the UK. Key takeaways from the survey Adoption demographics are gradually shifting from planning and proof-of-concept (POC) stages toward production. In 2020’s AI & Machine Learning, Infrastructure survey, 37% of adopters had AI in production, compared with 42% this year. This suggests the market is maturing. AI infrastructure is planned differently than other IT infrastructure. Two-thirds (66%) of organizations say they have an AI infrastructure purchasing strategy that is separate from the rest of their infrastructure purchasing plans. This percentage is even higher for those that plan their AI infrastructure in advance (75%) versus those that scale on demand (56%). AI infrastructure is different from regular infrastructure in many ways, and therefore requires different kinds of planning and resource allocation. Public cloud dominates AI workload venues. Last year’s trend toward public cloud has only been further solidified in this year’s survey. For respondents currently using AI/ML, public cloud is the most popular primary venue for storage (51%), training (39%) and inference (37%). Along with the cloud, containers are growing in popularity. Sixty-eight percent (68%) of organizations are using containerized environments for ML production, compared with 55% last year. However, container usage among our respondent base remains significantly more popular in the US than the UK. Demand is rising quickly – and spending with it. On average over the past 12 months, enterprises have spent about $1.5m on AI/ML infrastructure. When asked about future demand and spending, the large majority of enterprises (76%) anticipate demands on their infrastructure increasing over the next two years, so it comes as no surprise that, over the next 12 months, 82% of enterprises plan to increase their spending as well. Targets for that spending are led by accelerators (e.g., GPUs, TPUs), whether in the cloud or on-premises. COVID-19 has played a role in accelerating this spending increase. Sixty-four percent (64%) of organizations have increased AI infrastructure spending in response to COVID-19. Spending on AI has and will increase regardless, as demand was rising before the pandemic; however, it has served as a catalyst for both spending and adoption. The average organization takes three months to develop and deploy an ML model from conception to production. Our data suggests that IT-led projects gain approval significantly faster (nine",

Learn more.This voice experience is generated by AI. Learn more.Enterprise AI Adoption Is Rising, But The Conviction Is Still MissinggettyA dichotomy is forming between the personal and the professional when it comes to AI adoption. While generative AI and LLM-based technology options are being increasingly adopted by individuals for personal use, the same cannot be said for large enterprises. Trending terms such as “AI transformation”, |operating-model redesign”, and “enterprise readiness” dominate today’s technology dialogue, yet the reality of adoption and evolution on the ground is more measured. As I look across the marketplace, I see CIOs and CTOs preparing seriously for AI; but unfortunately, most enterprises still lack the conviction to make the large, structural investments required to unlock AI at scale. What specific preparations need to be made before this adoption can begin to mirror personal usage increase, then? And what is behind this hesitancy? Personal AI Adoption Is Surging, but Enterprises Are Moving Cautiously On the consumer side, AI is rocketing ahead. In our own firm, personal adoption is above 95 percent. Educated professionals commonly have multiple Large Language Models on their phones, using them for everything from productive work to quick research. This reflects a deep and wide B2C adoption pattern, similar to what I described in earlier blog analyses of generative AI’s ease of integration and current pricing dynamics. Yet this enthusiasm has not translated into enterprise-scale change. Most large companies have run numerous pilots. Employees use the tools, often enthusiastically, but the ROI remains incremental. For AI to unlock transformational value, enterprises must rethink core operating models, overhaul foundational technology, and redesign critical workflows. Those commitments are substantial, and we simply have not seen firms make them. MORE FOR YOUCIOs Are Locking Down on Preparation, Specifically on Governance, Security, and Vendor Simplification Although enterprises are not yet investing at scale, CIOs and CTOs are far from idle. Across industries, I see three clear patterns of preparation: 1. Building governance and security frameworks Leaders recognize that broad deployment requires rigorous guardrails. This stage mirrors the “last mile” challenges I have written about before, where compliance, security, and organizational alignment become the true bottlenecks to adoption. 2. Developing internal expertise. Companies are building AI fluency through training, small centers of excellence, and targeted hiring. Many are still determining how domain knowledge, functional insight, and prompt engineering will come together in their organizations. 3. Simplifying vendor portfolios. This is perhaps the most significant shift. During the Covid years, shortages of technology talent drove organizations to add vendors rapidly, creating an explosion in supplier portfolios. Today, I see broad, strategic efforts to consolidate these vendors. The motivation is partly cost, but more importantly, enterprises want a simpler, more manageable ecosystem to support AI-driven reinvention. Interestingly, this consolidation is changing market share dynamics. Historically, large low-cost providers were the disproportionate winners. Companies hesitated to shift work to new partners because of risk, and incumbents could defend their footprint. Now the pattern is different: firms are prioritizing capability over scale. Providers positioned around advanced operating models and AI transformation are gaining share, while specialist firms with deep expertise increasingly win work over traditional incumbents. These trends echo the broader shifts we have seen in how Global In-House Centers (GICs) and service providers compete on capability and integration rather than pure labor arbitrage. Why Enterprises Are Still Hesitant to Invest at Scale If preparation is happening everywhere, why is transformation not following? The answer lies in conviction. Companies understand that real value requires deep operating-model change, yet they have not aligned on what that future looks like. Technology teams often look to vendors to deliver innovation, while business lines expect the CIO to bring them fully formed solutions. Meanwhile, vendors themselves are racing to position their AI offerings, but their incentives do not always align with what enterprises truly need. This creates a strategic hesitation: firms want the benefits of AI but are unsure how much to rely on vendors versus internal capabilities, or how to sequence foundational investments that will not",

Enterprise AI now appears to be entering this phase.Today, we’re excited to introduce the state of enterprise AI report⁠(opens in a new window). For the first time, we’re sharing a comprehensive look at how enterprises are adopting AI, what workers say they’re gaining, and how organizational leaders are turning experimentation into measurable productivity and new capabilities.This analysis draws on two novel sources of data:Real-world usage data from enterprise customers of OpenAI.An OpenAI survey of 9,000 workers across almost 100 enterprises documenting patterns of AI adoption.All data points were deidentified and aggregated to preserve privacy.Adoption is accelerating and deepeningThe picture that emerges is clear: enterprise AI adoption is accelerating not just in breadth, but in depth. It is reshaping how people work, how teams collaborate, and how organizations build and deliver products.Over the past year weekly messages in ChatGPT Enterprise increased roughly 8×, and the average worker is sending 30% more messages.Usage of structured workflows such as Projects and Custom GPTs has increased 19× year-to-date, showing a shift from casual querying to integrated, repeatable processes.Average reasoning token consumption per organization has increased by approximately 320× in the past 12 months, suggesting that more intelligent models are being systematically integrated into expanding products and services.People aren’t just using AI more often. They are using it for increasingly sophisticated tasks. Enterprises are expanding both the extensive margin—more workers adopting AI—and the intensive margin—existing users going deeper.Growth is rapid across industries and geographiesAI is gaining traction across every sector, but we’re seeing especially strong momentum in:Technology, healthcare, and manufacturing, which are the fastest growing sectors.Professional services, finance, and technology, which operate at the largest scale.Globally, the fastest‑growing business customer bases include Australia, Brazil, the Netherlands, and France, each exceeding 140% year‑over‑year growth.International API customer growth has exceeded 70% over the last six months, with Japan having the largest number of corporate API customers outside of the U.S.Workers report measurable value from using AIAcross surveyed enterprises, 75% of workers report that using AI at work has improved either the speed or quality of their output. Workers report saving 40-60 minutes per day, with heavy users reporting more than 10 hours per week. Workers report AI is contributing to value across departments:87% of IT workers report faster IT issue resolution.85% of marketing and product users report faster campaign execution.75% of HR professionals report improved employee engagement.73% of engineers report faster code delivery.Crucially, AI is not just helping people do the same work faster—it is enabling people to do new kinds of work.Coding-related messages increased 36% for workers outside of technical functions.75% of users report being able to complete new tasks they previously could not perform.AI reduces the gap between intent and execution. Individuals can translate ideas into concrete outputs, regardless of their specialization or technical expertise.Frontier users and organizations are pulling aheadOur data shows a widening gap between “frontier” workers and firms, and the median.Frontier workers (95th percentile) send 6× more messages than the median employee and engage more intensively across advanced capabilities.Frontier firms send 2× more messages per seat and show deeper integration of AI across teams.These patterns are particularly meaningful given the finding that time savings increase as users consume more intelligence and engage across more distinct tasks.The AI landscape is evolving rapidly; OpenAI releases a new feature or capability roughly every three days. The primary constraints for organizations are no longer model performance or tooling, but rather organizational readiness and implementation.Looking ahead: AI reshaping the modern enterpriseThe state of enterprise AI report⁠(opens in a new window) is designed to do more than describe how AI adoption is changing, it’s meant to help organizations plan how to deploy more effectively.

AI Boom vs. Bubble For all the fears of over-investment, AI is spreading across enterprises at a pace with no precedent in modern software history. For nearly three years, AI enjoyed unwavering confidence and record capital flows. The surge crowned Nvidia the world’s most valuable company.1 Foundation models announced close to $1 trillion in AI infrastructure commitments. Venture funding surged back toward all-time highs, with nearly half of it concentrated in just a handful of frontier AI labs. Then the euphoria peaked. An MIT study2 claiming that 95% of generative AI initiatives fail rattled markets over the summer, exposing how quickly sentiment could shift beneath the weight of AI’s massive capex spend. The whispers of a bubble became a din. The concerns aren’t unfounded given the magnitude of the numbers being thrown around. But the demand side tells a different story: Our latest market data shows broad adoption, real revenue, and productivity gains at scale, signaling a boom versus a bubble. Enterprise AI has surged from $1.7B to $37B since 2023, now capturing 6% of the global SaaS market and growing faster than any software category in history. For Menlo’s third annual State of Generative AI in the Enterprise report, we surveyed ~500 U.S. enterprise decision-makers and combined their insights with a bottoms-up model of the generative AI market spanning model APIs, infrastructure, and applications. Since 2023, our team has tracked AI’s evolution from early experiments to broad enterprise deployment, giving us a multi-year view of the speed and scale of this transformation. Follow the Money: Where Do Enterprise Dollars Flow? Our data indicates companies spent $37 billion on generative AI in 2025,3 up from $11.5 billion4 in 2024, a 3.2x year-over-year increase. The largest share, $19 billion, went to the user-facing products and software that leverage underlying AI models, aka the application layer. This represents more than 6% of the entire software market, all achieved within three years of ChatGPT’s launch. Growth extends far beyond a handful of AI chat apps, touching every domain in the economy. By our count, there are now at least 10 products generating over $1 billion in ARR and 50 products generating over $100 million in ARR, led by the model APIs powering applications (Anthropic*, OpenAI, Google), but increasingly distributed across departmental solutions in coding, sales, customer support, HR, and verticals from healthcare and legal to the creator economy. In 2025, more than half of enterprise AI spend went to AI applications, indicating that modern enterprises are prioritizing immediate productivity gains vs. long-term infrastructure bets. How AI Enters the Enterprise: The Path to Production After three years, enterprise AI’s path to production has taken shape. Early adopters had no playbook. Now, distinct patterns have emerged that break from traditional SaaS. Enterprises prefer buying over building, showing stronger purchase intent, and adopting AI through product-led growth at a scale rarely seen in enterprise software. Enterprises Are Buying More Than Building For a while, the prevailing wisdom was that enterprises would build most AI solutions themselves. Bloomberg trained BloombergGPT for finance in 2022, Walmart built Wallaby for retail in 2024. Teams were confident that, with the right data, domain expertise, and scaffolding, they could handle everything in-house. In 2024, that confidence still showed in the data: 47% of AI solutions were built internally, 53% purchased.5 Today, 76% of AI use cases are purchased rather than built internally. Despite continued strong investments in internal builds, ready-made AI solutions are reaching production more quickly and demonstrating immediate value while enterprise tech stacks continue to mature. Last year, enterprises were split on building vs. buying. Today, enterprises have more ready-made AI solutions in production as their internal builds mature. AI Buyers Convert at Higher Rates Enterprise buyers approach AI with notably high intent. We found that, once an organization commits to exploring an AI solution, deals convert at nearly twice the rate of traditional software: 47% of AI deals go to production, compared to 25% for traditional SaaS. That elevated conversion reflects strong buyer commitment and clear immediate value. Our survey data reveals that most organizations surface a long list of potential AI use cases—often 10 or more—but focus their adoption on near-term productivity gains or cost savings. While enterprises identify slightly more internal-facing use cases (59%) than customer-facing ones (41%), both categories move through the pipeline at nearly identical rates, suggesting that operational AI investments deli",

Andrea Hill is a multi-industry CEO covering business & technology.Follow AuthorOct 03, 2025, 06:20pm EDTOct 19, 2025, 04:47pm EDTThe focus is now shifting to AI and competitive advantage, as companies rethink what will set them apart in the years ahead.Even without significant new advances in the technology, AI will change the nature of competitive advantage.gettyA New Era of CompetitionBusiness history is marked by shifts in how companies create advantage. In the industrial age, efficiency ruled, as Henry Ford transformed car manufacturing by lowering costs through assembly lines. In the late 20th century, Walmart became a giant by driving relentless supply chain efficiency, while McDonald’s standardized processes to deliver speed and consistency worldwide. The digital era added a new edge: speed and customer access. Amazon, for example, can introduce new features dozens of times a day, while Netflix can spot changes in viewer preferences and launch new shows before its rivals even notice the trend.We now stand on the edge of another transformation. As McKinsey recently noted in its paper “The Agentic Organization: Contours of the Next Paradigm for the AI Era” (Sept. 2025), artificial intelligence is shifting the source of competitive advantage once again. This is not about clever tools or chatbots, but rather, about rethinking the fundamentals of how value is created.The companies that understand this shift and act on it will win market share. Those that wait risk being left behind.From Efficiency to IntelligenceThe introduction of AI into core business operations does more than speed things up. It changes the math of business itself. For most of history, the cost of serving more customers rose in step with growth. To sell more cars, Ford had to build more factories. To expand retail, Walmart had to hire more people and open more stores. Digital businesses gained efficiency in how they reached customers and processed transactions, removing some of the friction of physical operations, but costs still rose as they scaled.MORE FOR YOUAI-first workflows would shift that equation. Once a process is redesigned to run primarily through intelligent systems, the cost of serving one more customer becomes minimal. McKinsey researchers describe this effect as driving “marginal costs toward the cost of compute.” In plain English, this means that whether you handle one customer or one million, the extra cost is almost negligible.Consider customer service. In the past, doubling call volume meant doubling staff. With AI systems handling the bulk of routine questions, a company can scale to millions of interactions while reserving its people for only the most complex cases. Human attention becomes more valuable, because it is spent on higher-order problems, not on volume.This is why AI doesn’t just improve efficiency. It rewrites the rules of how companies grow.This is a fundamental break from the past. For most of history, growth and cost were tied together. To serve more customers, you needed more employees, more equipment, or more stores. In the AI era, the relationship between growth and cost loosens. This changes how growth works, allowing companies to get bigger without the traditional jump in costs.Data Becomes the Raw Material of AdvantageIf AI is the engine, data is the fuel. But not all data is equal. Public data (the information available to anyone) is now accessible through shared AI systems. That means it offers no real competitive edge to anyone.What matters is the data only your company can capture: the customer histories, usage patterns, performance records, and sensor readings that reflect how your products and services work in the real world. McKinsey describes this as building a “walled garden” of proprietary data that competitors cannot easily replicate.Consider a manufacturer that tracks performance across thousands of machines in its plants. By analyzing that data, it can predict failures, reduce downtime, and design better products faster than competitors. Or picture a bank that uses decades of transaction data to create financial services tailored not just to a demographic group, but to individual households. These are insights no competitor can simply copy.Unfortunately, many companies are still struggling with more than messy data. They are running on outdated systems that can’t talk to each other, patching gaps with spreadsheets, and piling on shadow software (often not integrated) just to keep things moving. Critical platforms like ERP systems are often long past their prime, but leaders hesitate to upgrade because the work will be expensive and overwhelming. The choice, however, is stark: do the hard work of modernization now, or lose the chance to compete while waiting a little longer. Companies that invest in fixing these foundat",

More in this series Subscribe Get Copies Download PDF Share Twitter Facebook Linkedin Boris Séméniako/Ikon Images Summary: Artificial intelligence does not change anything about the fundamental nature of sustained competitive advantage when its use is pervasive. Once AI’s use is ubiquitous, it will transform economies and lift markets as a whole, but it will not uniquely benefit any single company. Businesses seeking to gain an innovation edge over rivals will need to focus their efforts on cultivating creativity among their employees. Listen to “Why AI Will Not Provide Sustainable Competitive Advantage” (13:24) There is no question that artificial intelligence will transform the competitive business landscape. AI will streamline business processes, increase worker productivity, redefine premium skill sets, and unlock the potential of data. There is also no question that AI will make relentless progress and become more capable at a dizzying pace. But AI will also become more ubiquitous. Algorithms and training data are being commoditized; hardware competition is fierce; talent is plentiful; open-source models reliably erode corporate offerings. AI will become increasingly economical to deploy, and competition will demand that companies do so. While it is impossible to predict exactly how AI will transform our economy, one thing is clear: Every company will want it, and there is essentially no reason why they will not be able to get it. It is tempting for a company to believe that it will somehow benefit from AI while others will not, but history teaches a different lesson: Every serious technical advance ultimately becomes equally accessible to every company. Personal computers, the internet, semiconductor fabs, blockchain technology, genetic sequencing — these technologies are no longer competitive advantages for any organization. AI is similar, and its increasing ubiquity should cause us to rethink our assumptions about how it will — and will not — change competitive dynamics. It is easy to paint a picture of a glistening, AI-driven future and the untold riches it harbors, ripe for the taking; it is just as easy to believe that companies that invest heavily in AI technology or move first will reap the lion’s share of potential profits. But all such narratives obscure a critical point: While there will doubtless be transitory competitive advantages in embracing AI, AI does not change the fundamentals of what makes for a sustainable competitive advantage. How can AI be the centerpiece of a sustained competitive advantage when everyone has it? We argue that it simply cannot. The value that AI unlocks will be unlocked for all. The advantages AI confers will be conferred on all. By definition, if everyone has access to the same technology — even if it is new and valuable — it may move the market as a whole but will not uniquely advantage anyone. Far from being a source of differentiation, artificial intelligence will be a source of homogenization.

What customers see when they visit an online store is no longer the same for everyone. AI-driven personalization transforms the e-commerce experience by analyzing customer behavior patterns and delivering tailored product recommendations that can increase conversion rates by up to 70%.Today's shoppers expect websites to understand their preferences and show them relevant products. AI-based personalization technology makes this possible by processing massive amounts of customer data in real-time. When a visitor browses a website, AI algorithms can instantly adjust product displays, search results, and even pricing based on that specific customer's history and preferences.The impact on business results is clear. Online stores using AI-driven personalization tools see higher average order values, improved customer loyalty, and increased sales. Instead of showing generic product collections, these smart systems create unique shopping journeys that feel custom-built for each visitor.Key TakeawaysAI personalization analyzes customer behavior to deliver tailored product recommendations that significantly boost conversion ratesSmart algorithms automatically adjust search results, product displays and pricing in real-time based on individual shopper preferencesImplementing AI-powered personalization creates unique shopping experiences that increase customer loyalty and average order valuesAI-Powered Onsite Personalization in EcommerceAI technology is transforming how online stores connect with shoppers. By analyzing customer data, AI creates tailored shopping experiences that boost sales and build loyalty.AI Personalization for Product DiscoveryFinding the right products quickly is essential for online shoppers. AI-powered personalization tools analyze past purchases, browsing behavior, and even demographic information to show each customer the most relevant items.These systems go beyond simple \"you might also like\" suggestions. They create dynamic product displays that change based on real-time behavior.For example:Products displayed change based on search terms usedCategory pages adjust to highlight items matching customer preferencesNew arrivals are filtered to show what's most relevant to each shopperProduct discovery becomes more efficient when AI handles the heavy lifting. Shoppers find what they want faster, and stores see higher conversion rates as a result.Personalized Shopper Journeys with AIEvery customer follows a unique path through an online store. AI personalizes this journey by adapting site navigation, content, and offers to match individual needs.When a customer returns to a site, AI recognizes them and creates continuity in their experience. The technology remembers where they left off and what they showed interest in previously.Key personalization touchpoints include:Homepage layouts tailored to visitor interestsCustom navigation menus highlighting relevant categoriesPersonalized banners and promotionsTargeted email follow-ups based on browse behaviorResearch shows that 70% of eCommerce decision makers believe AI improves their personalization efforts. This technology helps create shopping experiences that feel custom-designed for each visitor.Site Experience Enhancement via PersonalizationBeyond product recommendations, AI enhances the entire site experience through sophisticated personalization techniques.Smart sites now adjust elements like:Page layouts - Reorganizing content based on what a specific visitor engages with mostSearch functionality - Delivering results weighted toward individual preferencesPricing and promotions - Showing special offers most likely to convert each customerEven site speed and performance can be personalized.

The most important personalization features are: customer behavior tracking across every touch point is done with behavioral tracking the modification of AI customer experience is through real-time adaptation according to the behavior of the customers client needs and preferences are predicted with the help of predictive recommendations The technology can predict what they are curious about, through which channel they want to communicate with your business and at which stage of their perfect buying journey your next best touchpoint is.The hyper-personalization concept goes beyond merely deploying static AI algorithms alongside pre-defined workflows. The AI that eCommerce companies are after would be the one capable of operating independently to serve their purpose in a wise and personalized manner to each and every consumer. Agentic AI is changing the landscape of personalized consumer experiences and making them truly one-to-one by giving autonomy, adaptability, and real-time optimization to business operations.Benefits of AI-Powered Personalization for ConversionsArtificial Intelligence gives the possibility for eCommerce companies and sellers to rely less on basic trusting and more on real-time data, smart insights, and machine-made decisions. What do these new environments lead to? Shopping that is less time-consuming, more intelligent, and extremely customer-focused and oriented to making sales.Increased Conversion Rates: Guiding Shoppers to the Perfect PurchaseConversion rates are essential for the success of eCommerce. One of the reasons that AI-driven personalization is very important is that it makes AI customer experience very relevant for each shopper thus giving a direct impact on this measure. Customers visiting your site are usually introduced to many different types of products. Kids, if not properly guided, can get confused leading to dropping out. AI takes the role of a personal shopping assistant to support and relieve the situation.Enhanced Customer Engagement: Creating Interactive and Memorable ExperiencesArtificial intelligence aids retailers in providing dynamic and interactive shopping experiences that are not limited to merely showing products. AI-driven chatbots, for instance, can provide individual recommendations and give real-time responses to customer queries.Consequently, the buying process becomes more lively and dynamic, which attracts customers to the site for a longer period.Artificial intelligence can find opportunities to customize the message’s time and delivery by analyzing the customers’ behavior and preferences. For instance, a retailer might send a personalized e-mail containing a special discount to a customer who has shown interest in a particular category of products.Reduced Search Abandonment: Delivering Accurate and Relevant ResultsAI surpasses the traditional methods of matching keywords to understand what a customer is looking for through his or her search query. This implies that, no matter how complex or ambiguous the customer’s language is, AI will still be able to provide helpful results. AI also draws on past search activities and choices which it gradually enhances",

In this section, we’ll explore the evolution of personalization in CRO, from basic segmentation to AI-powered hyper-personalization, and what this means for businesses looking to stay ahead of the curve. The Personalization Gap: What Users Expect vs. What Brands Deliver The gap between what consumers expect from personalized experiences and what most companies actually deliver is a significant challenge in today’s market. According to recent research, 80% of consumers are more likely to make a purchase when brands offer personalized experiences, yet many companies still fail to meet these expectations. A study by SuperAGI found that 92% of executives expect to increase spending on Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the next three years, with 55% expecting significant investments. This trend reflects the growing importance of AI in enhancing conversion rates and overall website performance. However, despite this trend, many companies still rely on generic marketing approaches, neglecting the importance of personalization. 75% of consumers are more likely to return to a website that offers personalized recommendations. 65% of consumers are more likely to become repeat customers if a company offers personalized experiences. 60% of consumers are more likely to recommend a company that offers personalized experiences to friends and family. The consequences of providing generic experiences can be severe. A study found that 70% of consumers are frustrated with generic marketing messages, and 60% of consumers are more likely to switch to a competitor if a company fails to offer personalized experiences. This disconnect represents a significant opportunity for businesses to gain a competitive advantage by prioritizing personalized experiences. By leveraging AI and machine learning, companies can create highly individualized experiences that drive deeper connections, boost engagement, and increase conversions. For instance, AI-powered tools can analyze massive amounts of data to provide insights into user behavior, enabling businesses to make informed decisions for optimization.

    "extractedText": "For retailers, brands, and ecommerce businesses, last-mile delivery is often the most expensive and unpredictable part of the shipping process. Customers expect fast, reliable deliveries, and a poor last-mile experience can lead to frustration, bad reviews, and lost sales. The challenge? Choosing the right carrier and service for each package while balancing speed, cost, and reliability. Traditionally, businesses rely on static shipping rules, past experiences, or guesswork to make these decisions—but AI is changing that. AI-powered last-mile logistics solutions help businesses analyze carrier performance, automate shipping decisions, and improve delivery outcomes—all without the need to manage their own delivery fleets. “Start small with clear objectives and scale gradually.” – Kushal Pillay This blog is part of a series that dives into four major ways AI can transform your shipping strategy: Improving time-in-transit predictions (Read it here) Transforming the customer experience (Read it here) Eliminating inefficiencies in the warehouse (Read it here) Optimizing last-mile delivery Smarter carrier selection based on performance data Not all carriers perform equally across all regions, shipment types, or service levels. AI analyzes millions of past deliveries to identify: Which carriers consistently meet on-time delivery promises Which services perform best in specific locations or under certain conditions How carrier performance shifts based on seasonality, weather, and demand surges Instead of relying on trial and error, retailers can use AI-powered insights to select the best-performing carriers for each shipment. AI-driven shipping method optimization Many businesses overpay for shipping because they default to faster, more expensive options, assuming that’s what’s needed. AI removes the guesswork by automating shipping decisions based on: Cost vs. speed trade-offs (e.g., when ground shipping is just as fast as express) Delivery success rates (ensuring the chosen service is reliable in that region) Real-time carrier pricing and service availability For example, AI might analyze past shipments and recommend switching 40% of next-day air shipments to ground, saving thousands of dollars without affecting delivery times. Predictive delivery performance and customer experience Customers hate vague or inaccurate delivery windows. AI solves this by analyzing real-time shipping conditions and historical data to: Provide more accurate delivery estimates at checkout Proactively detect and alert customers about potential delays Optimize carrier selections based on on-time delivery trends in each region This not only reduces missed deliveries and customer complaints but also improves trust and satisfaction. Cost reduction and operational efficiency By continuously analyzing carrier pricing, delivery speed, and reliability, AI can help businesses: Reduce shipping costs by automatically choosing lower-cost options that still meet customer expectations Improve delivery success rates, reducing returns, re-ships, and lost packages Optimize multi-carrier shipping strategies to prevent bottlenecks and capacity issues For high-volume shippers, these optimizations can lead to massive cost savings and more predictable logistics operations. AI is reshaping last-mile delivery—not by optimizing fleet operations, but by helping businesses make smarter carrier and service choices. Instead of guessing which shipping method is best, AI analyzes real data, automates decisions, and continuously improves outcomes. Now is the time to invest in AI AI is no longer a luxury in logistics—it’s a necessity. From predicting delivery times with greater accuracy to enhancing customer service, optimizing warehouse operations, and improving last-mile efficiency, AI is transforming every stage of the supply chain. Companies that embrace AI-driven solutions gain a competitive edge, reduce costs, and improve overall efficiency, while those that hesitate risk falling behind. The logistics industry is evolving faster than ever, and AI is at the center of this transformation. By leveraging AI-powered tools, businesses can eliminate inefficiencies, enhance decision-making, and future-proof their operations. The question is no longer if AI will impact logistics—it’s how fast companies can adopt it to stay ahead.

    "extractedText": "News & Insights / Insights & Reports Machine Learning in Last-Mile Delivery: Transforming Logistics for the Future 08-19-2025 Technology Artificial intelligence and machine learning are poised to generate as much as $4.4 trillion in productivity gains across some of the world’s largest industries, including banking, technology, healthcare, retail, and logistics, according to McKinsey’s 2025 analysis. As last-mile delivery becomes an increasingly critical and costly part of the supply chain, machine learning is proving especially valuable. Machine learning-based systems adapt in real time to changing delivery conditions, learning from data to improve accuracy, responsiveness, and efficiency across various logistics networks. Routing is one of the clearest areas of impact. Machine learning is already being used to evaluate real-time traffic conditions, delivery time windows, and road constraints to recommend the most efficient route. FedEx has already implemented this approach through its proprietary Shipment Orchestration Engine, which actively routes packages based on priority and delivery conditions. Demand forecasting is also improving through machine learning. By analyzing historical delivery data alongside factors like seasonality, sales, and regional trends, logistics providers are enhancing their ability to anticipate order volumes and allocate resources more effectively. DHL reports using forecasting models that can predict shipment volumes with up to 95% certainty, enabling more precise planning of courier routes and delivery operations. Machine learning is also reducing service failures and improving the customer experience. Real-time tracking systems now update estimated delivery windows dynamically, based on actual conditions. AI tools have been implemented to identify and address errors, flag potential fraudulent transactions, and manage routine customer inquiries without human intervention. AI-powered chatbots and other machine learning tools have rapidly demonstrated their effectiveness and are becoming the standard across the logistics sector. As such, companies are continuing to invest in the infrastructure required to support and scale these systems. Machine learning-driven operational improvements are laying the groundwork for future delivery models. Autonomous technologies such as self-driving vehicles and aerial drones are in their nascent stages of development across a broad range of logistics and technology companies. These systems use advanced algorithms to interpret road conditions, detect obstacles, and make navigation decisions in real time. While still in pilot phases, this emerging technology points to broader shifts in how delivery may be more efficiently executed in dense or high-volume shipping areas. As logistics networks grow more complex and customer demands continue to increase, the role of machine learning will only expand. Beyond routing and forecasting, machine learning models are being trained to support predictive maintenance, electric vehicle optimization, and customer-specific delivery scheduling. In a high-velocity, cost-sensitive environment like last-mile delivery, even small gains in efficiency or reliability can create meaningful competitive advantages. Machine learning is driving a new era of logistics innovation, making last-mile delivery faster, smarter, and more sustainable as the technology continues to evolve.

    "extractedText": "The OneRail Industry Insights Blog Tech-Forward, People-First: The Future of AI in Last Mile Delivery Written by Bill Catania Posted on September 11, 2025September 11, 2025 Artificial intelligence is transforming everything from how packages are routed to how customers interact with support. In this era of innovation and transition, there’s no doubt that companies should be embracing technology. But the real question is: How do you effectively integrate AI in the last mile without losing the human element? Consumers today expect speed, precision and frictionless on-demand service. But they also want empathy, understanding and someone who can step in when something goes wrong. Case in point: While AI can optimize a delivery route in milliseconds, it can’t yet offer reassurance to a frustrated customer whose package didn’t arrive on time. The companies that are winning in this new landscape are the ones that understand this balance — those that lead with innovation but never lose sight of the human touch. Forward-thinking brands are on a mission to prove that tech-forward doesn’t mean people-last. In fact, it’s the blend of both that defines the future of last mile delivery. The Innovation Imperative: Why We Automate The delivery landscape has never been more competitive. Shippers are navigating a blend of challenges, including tight margins, labor constraints and rising customer expectations for speed, convenience and transparency. In this high-pressure environment, operational efficiency is the survival strategy. That’s why AI and automation have become essential tools for gaining an edge. These technologies have emerged as solutions for unlocking new levels of reliability, scalability and customer satisfaction across the entire delivery journey. AI and automation are helping wholesale distributors and retailers make smart and fast decisions in a variety of ways: Route Optimization: Finding the fastest, most cost-effective paths in real time. Mode Selection: Automatically choosing the best delivery method based on cost, dimensions, weight, speed and SLA requirements. Predictive Analytics: Anticipating delays, demand surges and customer needs before they happen. Proactive Communications: Automating updates and alerts to customers and internal teams. Inventory Management: Enabling real-time visibility and smarter fulfillment decisions. Exception Detection: Identifying and flagging issues before they become customer-facing problems. And the industry is moving quickly to embrace these tools. The AI-enabled last mile delivery solutions market is experiencing rapid growth, and many in the industry see AI and automation as key solutions for building efficiency amid complexity and maintaining margins in a world where the last mile accounts for 52% of fulfillment costs. In short, AI and automation are now the foundation for building a delivery network that can compete in today’s market. But Tech Alone Isn’t Enough While AI and automation have unlocked incredible speed and scale, they’re not without blind spots. In the race to digitize every interaction, many companies have unintentionally created a new kind of friction — one where the human touch is increasingly hard to find. We’ve all experienced it: a delayed delivery, an incorrect order or a last-minute change and no clear way to get help. Instead of speaking to a real person, customers are funneled into automated phone trees, chatbots or endless email loops. In many scenarios like this, frustration builds, trust erodes and brand loyalty takes a hit. In these moments when something falls outside the algorithm, automation alone falls short. These situations demand nuance, judgment and empathy. And yet, in many tech-driven systems, there’s no clear path for a human to step in and make it right. It’s a growing pain across the industry. As technology advances, so does the risk of alienating the very customers it’s meant to serve. Because when something goes wrong, people don’t want a script — they want a solution, and often, they want it from another human being.

During the event, she made a powerful observation: Tractor Supply is building a future-ready retail model that still feels personal and local. And that’s no easy feat. In a time when many retailers are chasing automation for its own sake, Tractor Supply stands out by using technology to enhance rather than replace the customer experience. Same-day pickups, localized fulfillment and intelligent delivery are all in play, but these innovations are grounded in one core truth: Tractor Supply’s customers still want real connections. Sometimes that means walking into a store to ask a question. Other times, it means expecting a delivery that arrives not just on time, but with care. What Tractor Supply understands is that",

As consumer expectations continue to rise, businesses are under pressure to deliver faster, more reliably, and more transparently than ever before.At Dispatch, we work with companies of all sizes, from single-location businesses to enterprise logistics teams, and we’ve seen a common pattern emerge: organizations at every scale are turning to AI to bring clarity, control, and cost-efficiency to the final mile.This blog breaks down how AI can support two key audiences:Small to mid-sized businesses (SMBs): Often running lean operations with minimal tech infrastructure.Large enterprise organizations: Managing distributed delivery networks, tech stacks, and partnerships.Let’s look at how AI-powered solutions are built to support lean and complex operations, meeting the needs of businesses of all sizes while ensuring their last-mile logistics are scalable, efficient, and ready for what’s next.For Small & Mid-Sized Businesses: Doing More with LessYou don’t need a Chief Technology Officer or an in-house data science team to use AI. In fact, AI is most impactful when it simplifies your job, not complicates it. Here’s how SMBs are getting ahead:Effortless Route Optimization That Saves Time & FuelManually building delivery routes or relying on static mapping tools is a thing of the past. AI-driven route optimization automatically:Plans the most efficient path based on traffic, delivery windows, and geography.Reoptimizes in real time if something changes (e.g., cancellations, road closures).Cuts down on fuel costs and idle time, maximizing driver output.Case in point: After partnering with Dispatch, Piedmont Plastics’ Thornwood, NY branch gained the ability to schedule last-minute pickups and reliably commit to 1–2 day delivery windows. This shift enabled faster, more customized delivery options—without relying on unreliable local couriers or waiting days for LTL shipments. Read the full case study here.Seamless Communication with Customers, Without Extra StaffFinal-mile visibility shouldn’t require constant manual updates. AI enables:Predictive ETAs that adjust in real time.Automated SMS/email notifications that are triggered by delivery milestones.Post-delivery follow-up to gather customer feedback—all running on autopilot.This keeps your customers in the loop and your phones from ringing nonstop.Smart Insights That Are ActionableYou don’t need to be a data analyst to understand what’s working and what isn’t. AI-powered dashboards turn raw data into meaningful performance insights:How often are you delivering on time?Which drivers or routes are consistently underperforming?Are customers more satisfied on certain delivery days or time windows?These insights help small teams make quick, confident decisions with measurable ROI.For Enterprises: Driving Intelligence at ScaleLarge organizatio",

    "extractedText": "Luxury products have long held a timeless, classic energy in culture. But with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), the luxury industry must also evolve. Futuristic, modern technologies are taking over. Luxury brands must follow to keep up with customer satisfaction. AI technology can offer many benefits in terms of marketing and the customer experience. Not only can it allow business processes to run smoother, it can also take the guesswork out of marketing initiatives. It tracks exactly what customers shop for when browsing a business’s products. This helps to streamline marketing efforts and better control inventory. Learn more about how AI technology is changing the world of luxury retail. How is AI used in luxury retail? AI-powered technology has made headlines in recent news—and it’s not predicted to stop there. It has changed the way many industries work, including the luxury goods industry. Luxury shoppers need an amplified experience. That means businesses must keep up to meet their demands. AI technology can be an excellent tool for catering to those who shop in the luxury market. How? Let’s look at some examples. How has AI improved the customer experience in luxury retail? Luxury retail brands are already using AI in a variety of ways to improve the front-end customer journey. More Personalized Experiences Dior and Louis Vuitton are using AI-enabled chatbots to connect with customers at scale in a way that still looks like natural language, including the use of emojis. This means they can provide more personalized experiences across more customers with less manual effort. L’Occitane is using machine learning to provide customers with personalized experiences, including personalized product recommendations. This not only provides customers with a highly curated experience, but also increases conversion rates and boosts sales. Creative Campaigns that Connect Brands like Moncler, Zegna, and Valentino have started using AI to create campaigns. Blending AI-generated content with human creativity to create the kind of new brand experiences that luxury customers crave. Interactive Online Brand Experiences Sephora uses Modiface AI technology to power their online Visual Artist. This virtual makeup experience lets customers upload a photo of themselves so they can “try on” makeup to see how different products will look on them. Not only does this offer customers a fun and interactive brand experience they’re likely to share with friends, it boosts online sales by removing the risk of buying a color you haven’t tried on in person. Deeper Customer Insights Prada Group is using AI to gain deeper insights into their customers. These insights enable them to deliver high-quality content faster across a range of multi-channel communications. Once again, driving increased sales. But the benefits of AI are not limited to front-end customer experiences. How can AI improve operational efficiencies in luxury retail? There are several ways in which AI can drive operational efficiencies. Burberry is using AI for image analysis to identify counterfeit products. They use machine learning to analyze millions of images and identify subtle irregularities and inconsistencies in product properties (like size, shape, color, texture, and angles) so they can identify which products are genuine and which are fake. Ralph Lauren is using AI across many different business functions for tasks like copy editing, graphics, and code generation. Improved Demand Forecasting Some ecommerce search engines, like Constructor, now provide AI-driven product attribute enrichment tools. Why are they important? These tools help improve product discovery and the relevance of search results. They can also be used to enable AI-generated product descriptions. While these AI-generated descriptions may need to be edited for a luxury audience, using AI can reduce the effort required, thereby increasing the efficiency of product information managers. What’s more, having a lot of defined product attributes for each item you sell has another benefit: Improving demand forecast accuracy. Especially for predicting demand for products without any historical sales data—which is often the case for seasonal items. Traditionally, very large sets of product attributes have only been created for commoditized products that don’t change often due to the effort involved. But now, AI tools easily enable the creation of product attributes, making AI-driven demand forecast accuracy a more viable approach, even for seasonal items. Brands that invest in attribute enhancement will be in the best position to take full advantage of AI-driven demand forecasting solutions, like Relex and Toolsgroup. What other data can be used to increase AI-driven demand forecast accuracy? Digital demand signals. For example, the number of times a customer checks if an item variant (e.g., in a particular size / color combination) is in stock vs. the number of orders for that item. Which is",

(Photo by ERIC PIERMONT / AFP) (Photo by ERIC PIERMONT/AFP via Getty Images)AFP via Getty ImagesLuxury brands are widely using basic AI for data analysis to forecast demand, in supply chain management and to support other operational uses, but the emergence of generative AI (GenAI) takes AI to a whole new level, both maximizing the opportunities and the challenges.Basic AI is programmed to analyze data, identify patterns and make predictions. Its scope is limited and its range narrow. GenAI has no such limits. It is programmatically trained to analyze data inputs from multiple sources and create new content and information in a variety of formats, including text, photos, video and audio. GenAI mimics human creativity, though it lacks human cognitive abilities and contextual understanding. It holds the promise to expand human limits and accomplishments, but it has no moral compass or as retail industry analyst Robin Lewis observes, “What it doesn’t deliver is wisdom, insight, and context. It is soulless.”For example, Senator Richard Blumenthal opened a Congressional hearing on the dangers of AI by playing a recorded message of what sounded like his voice saying words he didn’t write. His voice and speech were created by GenAI, but it could have just as easily been a video given GenAI’s power. Luxury brands design products reflecting the highest levels of human creative achievement. The brands prosper in the marketplace on authenticity and person-to-person connections that build trust. Rather than enhancing those qualities, the irresponsible use of GenAI can threaten them. MORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton ContributorAs the luxury market leader, LVMH has the most to gain from AI if used effectively and the most to lose if AI is deployed improperly. And given its scale, LVMH has unmatched resources to discover AI’s potential. That’s why it’s getting the best minds behind it to explore the uncharted waters of artificial intelligence. It recently hosted a three-day LVMH Data AI Summit in Paris, bringing together students and practitioners to explore innovative AI applications. And it has aligned with Stanford University’s Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence Institute (Stanford HAI), which is on the forefront of research in the retail sector for AI safety, human-centered design, human-computer interactions and other areas.“Recent generative AI breakthroughs show new opportunities for major innovation and efficiency but also challenges and risks. LVMH will accelerate the efforts to learn and experience how it can help the business,” the company said in a statement. Risks And RewardsHuman creativity is the lifeblood of LVMH’s 75 brands, called Maisons, as well as the luxury market in general. If GenAI can enhance that creativity, then luxury brands will gain the most from investments in its capabilities. A Deloitte survey found 20% of retailers plan to use GenAI to augment the creative process. LVMH recognizes GenAI’s creative potential in the luxury market. “While these technologies offer remarkable creative potential, making it possible to generate bespoke designs and personalized experiences, they also raise questions about authenticity, as well as responsibility,” it stated. At the same time, luxury brands like LVMH have long recognized the essential role of the human element – the person-to-person connection – in the retail environment. That was the main reason why luxury brands were slow to adopt e-commerce. This is where the Stanford HAI partnership comes into play. “Stanford HAI’s mission focuses on how to properly design and build human-centered AI to have positive human impacts,” Stanford HAI’s vice director of research James Landay said in a statement.The statement continued, “The LVMH luxury group will work with faculty and students to better understand current advances in this technology and how to augment employees without replacing them.” Stanford HAI’s managing director for industry programs and partnerships, Panos Madamopoulos-Moraris, explained: “We are poised to guide AI’s evolution in creative and consumer industries, an area relatively underexplored compared to enterprise applications. We look forward to working with LVMH, our first European member, as we aim to augment creative minds, enable the safe development of large models in luxury, and translate artifici",
