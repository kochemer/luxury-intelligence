  "finalImagePrompt": "A photorealistic scene in a luxury jewelry boutique in New York City, with a wide horizontal banner composition. A jewelry store manager, with a subtle raised eyebrow, discreetly checks a smartphone while presenting a natural diamond to an affluent customer. The scene should capture the interplay of luxury and technology, with real materials, authentic reflections, and no text or signage in view. Use candid lighting, a mid-action shot, and maintain a wide, horizontally expansive format with all elements in the central horizontal band, leaving safe margins at top and bottom. Avoid stock photo appearances; ensure realism and human interaction elements.",
