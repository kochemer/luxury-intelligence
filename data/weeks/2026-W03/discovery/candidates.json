Here are the trends, strategies, and data you need to know in 2025. by Leah Levine Kaminsky / Michael KeenanThe platform built for future-proofingGet in touchThe fashion and apparel industry continues to demonstrate its dominant position in ecommerce. The sector has achieved a remarkable $781 billion market value—a number projected to more than double within six years. Still, fashion retailers face many macroeconomic headwinds. There are mixed signals on whether inflation is set to continue, but scarred consumers are still buying with caution. According to Ipsos's 2024 global consumer research, 32% of consumers across 29 countries still cite inflation as their primary worry. While major retailers initially responded with price increases, they've faced strong resistance from inflation-weary consumers prioritizing essential spending. The National Retail Federation reports that retailers' gross margins are actually lower now than during most of the pre-pandemic period, demonstrating that price increases were driven by rising input costs rather than profit-taking. Shifts in the demanded customer experience are also proving challenging, especially among younger consumers. Recent data from McKinsey shows over 75% of consumers are trading down their purchases for better value and pricing. When you zoom in to Gen Z and millennials, that number rises to 86%. This demographic increasingly craves sustainable retail—though reviews are mixed on whether they’re willing to pay for it. And they also want tech-enabled shopping, blending digital and physical retail environments. Fashion brands must now navigate these complex market conditions while adapting to evolving consumer preferences. There are a lot of needles to thread, but getting it right streamlines both the consumer and the back-end experiences to drive growth, keep fashion brands nimble, and unlock innovation. Top fashion ecommerce trends for 2025 Here’s a quick look at the trends we’ll be diving into: Social commerce and shoppable content Unified shopping experiences A personalized customer journey AI, AI, AI The continuation of the metaverse The rise of resale Digital payments as a growth-driver Sustainability—with caveats Community through IRL experiences Diversification of business models 1. Social commerce and shoppable content Social media plays an integral role in many online fashion brands’ ecommerce marketing strategies. That’s hardly surprising—our daily lives are no longer complete without our smartphones. The typical social media user now spends about 143 minutes daily on social media, which equals nearly 2½ hours. In an average lifespan of 73 years, that’s nearly 6 years of their life. Some 62% of consumers watch videos to learn about a product or brand before they buy. Platforms like TikTok and Instagram drive sales for large fashion brands, allowing shoppers to visualize the product on a real person—and there are bonus points if it’s through a social media influencer they already trust. But social media is no longer a place for shoppers to just learn about new fashion trends; it’s also a place for shoppers to buy as they learn, through in-app, integrated shopping experiences. This shortens the line between influencer product promotion and an actual purchase, right inside the apps where customers are already engaged, such as Instagram, TikTok Shop, Meta, buyable pins on Pinterest, and more. In fact, social commerce sales are expected to reach one in five sales by 2025, with 70% of Instagram users looking to the social media platform for their next purchase. Newer to the social selling sphere, TikTok Shop’s integrated shopping journeys show particular potential, providing access to the platform’s more than 33 million users. Current projections for shopping on the platform from Capital One indicate that 43% of users will use it to make purchases by 2027. TikTok Shop is easy to use with your Shopify store with an integration that helps you easily create videos, track conversions, and optimize campaigns through instant data reporting. That’s just one app among many in the Shopify app store which fashion retailers can easily plug in to instantly tap into the latest selling trend at low cost and low risk—and without having to wait 6 to 12 months to work its way through a developer’s queue. As social selling channels evolve, the ability to pivot your tech, selling, and marketing strategy quickly is key. 2. Unified shopping experiences The shopping experience is more multichannel than ever—especially in the fashion space. Consumers want to discover a new look from an influencer on social media, research reviews online, try items on in-store, and return them with a third-party logistics provider (3PL). While many brick-and-mortar stores closed during the pandemic, more and more",

    "extractedText": "The AI in fashion market size has grown exponentially in recent years. It will grow from $1.26 billion in 2024 to $1.77 billion in 2025 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 40.4%. The growth in the historic period can be attributed to visual search and recognition, supply chain optimization, virtual try-on solutions, fraud detection, sustainable practices. The AI in fashion market size is expected to see exponential growth in the next few years. It will grow to $6.99 billion in 2029 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 41%. The growth in the forecast period can be attributed to voice-activated shopping, predictive trend analysis, dynamic pricing strategies. Major trends in the forecast period include virtual try-on experience, personalized recommendations, computer vision for style recognition, supply chain optimization, chatbots and virtual assistants.The burgeoning impact of social media within the fashion industry stands as a catalyst for the expansion of AI in the fashion market. Social media has evolved into a crucial information hub for the fashion sector, offering a plethora of opinions and global insights. Present-day fashion heavily relies on brand promotion and endorsements by fashion influencers who leverage social media platforms to communicate their perspectives on trends. For instance, data from influencer marketing hub indicates a substantial growth in the influencer marketing market, soaring from $9.7 billion in 2020 to $13.8 billion in 2021. The rise in popularity of short video formats on platforms such as TikTok, Facebook, and YouTube, coupled with the pandemic-induced surge in social media consumption, has significantly contributed to this trend. Additionally, marketers' increased utilization of data collection for social media advertising optimization further fuels this growth. The escalating influence of social media thus continues to propel the advancement of AI in the fashion market.The burgeoning penetration of e-commerce is a significant driver behind the growth of the AI in the fashion market. E-commerce, or electronic commerce, involves the online buying and selling of goods and services. The expanding landscape of e-commerce has propelled the necessity for artificial intelligence (AI) in the fashion industry. Online retailers utilize AI algorithms to deliver personalized shopping experiences, optimize product search results, and elevate customer engagement and loyalty. For example, data from The United States Census Bureau in November 2023 indicates a 7.6% increase (±1.2%) in e-commerce estimates for Q3 2023 compared to Q3 2022, with e-commerce sales accounting for 15.6% of total sales in the third quarter of 2023. Hence, the escalating penetration of e-commerce serves as a driving force behind the growth of AI adoption within the fashion market.Major companies in the AI fashion market are concentrating on developing machine learning technologies, such as AI platforms, to enhance personalization, optimize inventory, and streamline supply chains. These advancements aim to improve customer experience and promote sustainability within the industry. An AI platform serves as a comprehensive environment that offers tools and resources for the development, deployment, and management of artificial intelligence applications. It generally includes development frameworks, data management, computational resources, and deployment services. For example, in October 2023, Mango, a Spain-based outlet store company, launched Lisa, its conversational generative AI platform. This platform streamlines processes and enhances user experience by providing instant support for design, trend analysis, and customer service. It acts as a co-pilot for employees, fostering efficiency and innovation as part of the company's digital transformation strategy.Major players in the AI in fashion sector are actively engaged in pioneering technologies, particularly virtual try-on tools. These digital innovations enable users to virtually experience or try on products, primarily within the realm of online shopping. For example, in June 2023, Google LLC, a leading technology company headquartered in the USA, unveiled the 'AI Try-On' platform. This platform allows customers to engage with products marked with a 'Try On' badge, offering the ability to virtually visualize how tops from renowned brands such as H&M, Loft, Everlane, and Anthropologie would appear on different models. This cutting-edge technology serves as a visual aid for consumers, facilitating the envisioning of clothing on individuals with diverse characteristics, encompassing various sizes (ranging from XXS to 4XL), skin tones, body shapes, and hair types.In July 2024, Hi-Tech Apparel, a manufacturing company based in Thailand, acquired Unmade for an undisclosed amount. Through this acquisition, Hi-Tech Apparel intends to establish a digital-first, sustainable manufacturing model that improves customization and responsiveness to market demands",

According to McKinsey & Company, the digital fashion transformation is not just imminent but essential. Their consumer sentiment surveys revealed a decline in offline shopping intent of 70–80%, while online shopping intent dropped by 30–40% in Europe and North America. This indicates a significant shift toward eCommerce, with data suggesting that some offline sales might permanently transition online. Fashion changes are evident in this shift. Furthermore, digital tools are not just enhancing sales channels but are also revolutionizing cost structures, supply chains, and customer acquisition strategies. The data-driven approach is becoming the backbone of the apparel industry, with fashion companies that have robust digital and analytics capabilities outperforming their competitors. Fashion changes are reshaping the industry. In this dynamic environment, operational excellence becomes paramount. It’s not just about keeping up with the fashion cycle; it’s about leveraging it to create a resilient, agile, and forward-thinking business model. The future of fashion looks promising with these advancements. The Pillars of Apparel Operations In today’s fast-paced fashion world, the pillars of apparel operations have become more crucial than ever. Starting with the design stage, brands are now focusing on adapting to fast fashion while also incorporating sustainable design trends. Digital tools have become instrumental in planning and executing collections based on real-time market dynamics. When it comes to sourcing and procurement, the emphasis is on building flexible supply chains that are also ethical, ensuring that clothing and products are sourced responsibly. The production and manufacturing processes have seen a surge in the adoption of technology, with digital solutions streamlining processes and emphasizing sustainability in fashion. Efficient collection management, accurate forecasting, and alignment with market requirements are becoming standard practices. Fashion changes are evident in these processes. Distribution and logistics are being optimized for efficiency and speed, ensuring that products reach consumers promptly. And, of course, in retail and sales, the balance between traditional brick-and-mortar stores and eCommerce strategies is pivotal. Brands are leveraging sales data and competitor analyses to refine product offerings and optimize merchandising strategies, ensuring they remain competitive in both physical and digital marketplaces. The luxury sector and the niche fashion sector are also adapting to these fashion changes. How Technology Addresses a Wide Range of Challenges in the Apparel Industry and Enhances Operations ERP Systems In the dynamic world of fashion, where trends can shift overnight, the pillars of apparel operations are more vital than ever. Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, particularly solutions like ApparelMagic, are proving to be the linchpin in fortifying these pillars. Starting with design and development, ERPs facilitate the seamless integration of design conceptualization with market demands, allowing brands to swiftly adapt to fast fashion while championing sustainable fashion. Tools embedded within these systems empower brands to meticulously plan and execute collections, reflecting real-time market dynamics. For sourcing and procurement, ERPs emphasize the creation of agile and ethical supply chains. They ensure materials and clothing products are sourced responsibly, with traceability features that offer transparency from raw material to finished product. In the realms of production and manufacturing, the infusion of technology via ERPs has led to streamlined processes that prioritize sustainable practices. They enable efficient collection management, precise demand forecasting, and production alignment with market needs. When we venture into distribution and logistics, the prowess of ERPs shines through. They optimize operations for maximum efficiency and speed, ensuring timely product delivery to consumers. This rapidity is crucial in an age where consumer demand and expectations are sky-high. Finally, in retail and sales, ERPs play a pivotal role in striking the right balance between traditional brick-and-mortar outlets and burgeoning eCommerce platforms. They provide invaluable sales data and competitor analyses, allowing brands to fine-tune product offerings and hone merchandising strategies. This ensures brands maintain a competitive edge in both physical stores and the vast digital marketplace.

In new research from Google and Vogue Business, they share the latest opportunities in AI for fashion and luxury brands, and how new technologies are changing purchasing behaviours.An AI revolution is underway in the world of fashion. New tools, powered by AI, are transforming how retailers are personalising the shopping journey to make the consumer’s life easier. AI is also helping fashion brands design new products, and cut down on waste.New research from Vogue Business reveals how AI is changing consumers’ purchasing behaviours in Europe. Consumers are eager for an AI-led shopping experience — two thirds of respondents said they are “somewhat excited” or “very excited” for designer fashion brands to introduce more AI applications in the next 1-3 years.1They are even willing to spend more with retailers who have used AI tools for product personalisation, to improve the shopping experience online, and to develop sustainable practices. Nearly three in 10 (29%) are willing to spend an extra 20% or more with a brand that uses AI applications.2Here’s how retailers can successfully embrace these tools to meet the consumer needs of today — and reap higher returns at the same time.Boosting the customer experience with AIEver since the introduction of online shopping, the fashion industry has sought to bridge the gap between the in-store experience — where shoppers are able to search through store racks and physically try on items to find the perfect fit — and online. Forty-three per cent of consumers said they would be prepared to spend at least 10% more on personalised shopping online.3AI is already present at several touchpoints on the customer journey. Fashion retailers are able to incorporate AI tools to reflect the in-store experience to the online shopper. Visual search tools like Google Lens mean consumers no longer need to rely on product descriptors, but instead search with what the item actually looks like.Once the shopper has found their perfect designer dress, augmented reality (AR) try-on tools adopted by retailers can allow the shopper to ensure the right fit and style. These tools resonate well: 49% of luxury consumers think that brands using AI offer a better experience.4 But there is great potential for even more advanced uses of AI tools.Tommaso Vaccarella is co-founder and general manager at Connected-Stories, a creative personalisation platform, driven by AI. Connected-Stories uses generative AI models to optimise the ad creative production process for brands across several industry verticals, including a number of fashion brands.He says: “The industry can use generative AI models to personalise the consumer experience throughout the entire consumer journey, not just at the first touchpoint.”Consumers of luxury brands want a VIP experience — in-store they are accustomed to personal shoppers and glamorous outlets. Now, AI is helping marketers provide the same level of personalisation for their customers online.AI at the heart of e-commerce personalisationResearch shows that using generative AI tools to create personalised deals, offers, and recommendations on products has a positive impact on fashion consumers' purchase motivations. More than three in ten (31%) consumers are willing to spend up to 20% more for a brand that does this.5From the use of generative AI to craft engaging storytelling in marketing communications, to the use of AI to generate personalised ads across platforms, retailers have enhanced opportunities to connect with consumers — and drive revenue.Italian fashion retailer Benetton used browsing and purchasing data to provide personalised product recommendations to customers with Recommendations AI. They found the average spending value of customers using the tool was 7% higher, and the time spent on the site almost tripled, compared to those who did not interact with the tool.Connected-Stories is built on Google Cloud. The platform utilises machine learning models with their clients, including a number of fashion brands, to allow for ad creatives to be automated, personalised, and delivered to users in real time.Vaccarella explains: “Based on data such as consumer shopping habits and interests, the time of day, and even geolocation and weather conditions, the right audience will see the right creative ad, which has been AI generated using brands' creative guidelines such as color, tone of voice, image styles, graphics usage, and more.“For example, you might find that a certain type of backdrop on your ad r",

We spoke to retailers who are seeing results.By Amanda CoffeeFebruary 25, 2025Photo: Noor-u-NisaSave StorySave this storySave StorySave this storyGenerative AI has dominated the retail tech hype cycle in the past year. But does it have staying power as a strategy to drive sales in a slowdown?Aggressive investment in AI has trickled all the way up to the executive branch. President Trump signed an executive order in late January removing barriers to American AI innovation, allowing companies to develop and deploy AI without regulatory restrictions. A hands-off approach has set up the playing field for an intense race among retailers to integrate AI rapidly and maintain a competitive edge.Benjamin Fels, CEO and co-founder of AI supply chain firm Pendulum, notes that Trump’s $500 billion AI infrastructure investment could help US retailers compete with foreign e-commerce giants by enabling faster supply chains and predictive analytics. US retailers struggle to match Shein’s 30-day inventory turnover and 6,000 daily product launches, as well as mitigate the $1.5 trillion in global annual losses from supply-demand disconnects. Fels describes this as a global “algorithmic warfare”, where brands are racing to implement more AI-powered algorithms and personalised merchandising strategies to compete with Chinese retailers.The same week as that executive order, China released DeepSeek-R1, a high-performance generative AI model built for roughly $5.5 million — far less than the tens of billions spent by Microsoft, Meta and Google on similar models, or the $500 billion invested by OpenAI and SoftBank. Rather than relying on expensive high-end chips, DeepSeek was developed using young engineering talent, making it a cost-effective alternative. Unlike TikTok, DeepSeek is open-source, making it nearly impossible for the US government to ban it, as users can freely download and distribute its data.DeepSeek’s early success suggests that Chinese AI development could accelerate even faster than anticipated with technology on par with US AI. This presents an opportunity for global retailers from luxury to fast fashion to embrace open-source AI to enhance trend prediction, personalisation and customer experiences — potentially widening their competitive edge.In 2024, 70 per cent of retail executives planned to implement generative AI, Carrie Tharp, VP of industries at Google Cloud, previously told Vogue Business. However, most brands were still in the ideation phase, exploring possibilities without major investments. Although many retailers have stated that they plan to implement AI, the investment to build in-house AI tools or purchase from partners is a costly multi-year endeavour. It’s yet to be seen if retailers commit to these investments long enough to see lasting results for customer engagement and sales.“2024 was a year of AI exploration in retail, but 2025 is when we’re seeing innovations deliver measurable results,” says Ali Furman, consumer markets industry leader at PwC US. “Retailers are increasingly using AI to turn customer behaviour, preferences and purchase history into actionable insights that enhance operations, personalise marketing and optimise inventory decisions.” Furman noted that AI-driven personalised experiences are particularly crucial for targeting Gen Z shoppers, who adopt new fashion trends faster than older consumers.Redefining personalisationVictoria’s Secret has transformed its email marketing strategy using AI personalisation. Previously, the brand sent the same daily emails to all customers based on product and brand priorities rather than individual preferences, according to Lindsay Massey, vice president of marketing. Now, marketing emails are customised to each customer type, leading to double-digit increases in revenue per email, click-through rates and conversion rates. For example, Gen Z customers might receive promotions for logo bralettes, while millennials who previously purchased shapewear see recommendations for smoothing strapless bras.Victoria’s Secret marketing emails are customised to each customer type.

I founded two companies in the field of data visualization, and for over ten years, I have been working to bridge the gap between humans and data. I’m delighted to be here with you for a new episode of The Bridge, Artefact’s media platform that explores artificial intelligence and its accessibility for everyone. Today, I’m joined by Edouard de Mézerac. Edouard, welcome! Could you introduce yourself?Hello! I’m very happy to be here today. My name is Edouard de Mézerac, and I joined Artefact in 2018. At that time, I was living in Shanghai, China, where I was already witnessing the early rise of data as a key driver of transformation. I remember my parents questioning my decision to join a new company from scratch, asking why I was taking such a risk. I had a cover of The Economist from April 2018 that read, « AI Will Disrupt Everything. » That moment reinforced my belief that something significant was happening, and I was drawn to the idea of joining a company fully dedicated to data and AI, especially to launch its activities in China. I spent four years growing Artefact’s business in Shanghai until 2022, then moved to Singapore for a short period. In total, I spent eight years in Asia before recently returning to Paris to take on a more global role at Artefact. Now that our teams across Asia have grown, I’m excited to be back in Paris and France.What is your personal experience with data and AI in the luxury industry?At Artefact, I currently lead our industry practices. Until now, our organization was primarily structured by country, but we felt the need for consistency and strong thought leadership within specific industries. As a result, we now have dedicated industry practices, including financial services, industrials, and, of course, luxury and beauty.I have spent considerable time working in the luxury sector. Over the past eight years, we have collaborated with nearly all major luxury groups across China, the US, and Europe, giving us a holistic view of the industry.The luxury market experiences constant fluctuations, often driven by overreactions. If we had this conversation three weeks ago, the atmosphere would have been quite gloomy. However, last week, a major luxury group published its Q4 2024 results, announcing a 10% year-on-year revenue increase. This surprised many, leading to a surge in stock prices across the luxury sector. This is a clear example of how the market tends to overreact to short-term changes.In reality, 2024 has been a challenging year, especially in China. The Chinese luxury market declined by 20%, which is a drastic drop. However, when we analyze Chinese luxury buyers as a whole—including those purchasing abroad—the decrease is only around 7-8%. This is because a significant share of luxury purchases by Chinese consumers now occurs outside China.For example, Japan saw a major boost in luxury sales due to currency fluctuations. The Japanese yen weakened against the Chinese renminbi, creating a price gap of around 30%. As a result, Chinese tourists flocked to Japan to buy luxury goods at significantly lower prices. This shows how complex and nuanced the luxury market in China can be.Beyond China, the US remains a key market for luxury. The current trend is positive, with expectations of at least 5% year-on-year growth in the coming years. While China may no longer be the primary growth engine for luxury brands, the US is poised to take on a more significant role.What is the current data and AI maturity of luxury companies based on your own observations?Luxury brands are well-positioned to leverage data effectively. Most luxury brands operate on a direct-to-consumer model, meaning they have detailed information about their customers. Unlike industries such as consumer packaged goods, where brands rely on intermediaries and have limited consumer data, luxury brands can track and analyze customer behavior in great detail.We recently conducted a study using public data from LinkedIn to assess the data maturity of luxury companies. We analyzed the number and types of data-related roles in these organizations. A few key takeaways emerged. All luxury brands have significantly increased their data teams, with some having hundreds or even thousands of data professionals. However, there are major differences between companies. Some have heavily invested in data, while others lag behind. For instance, LVMH leads in data talent, with a high ratio of data professionals to total employees. Other groups, such as Gucci, Chanel, and Hermès, have a significantly lower proportion of data talent.One key challenge is the shortage of product owners—the professionals responsible for translating business needs into data-driven solutions. Many luxury brands lack these roles, which creates a disconnect between data teams and business objectives. The most mature companies have structured product owner teams by brand or category to ensure alignment between data initia",

Today’s jewelry consumers expect seamless omnichannel experiences, personalized service, and innovative technology that enhances rather than replaces human connection. Trend 1: Hybrid Live Commerce Experiences What It Is Live commerce combines live streaming, video consultations, and real-time purchasing in an integrated experience. Think QVC meets luxury boutique, but interactive and personalized.

In this section, we’ll explore the evolving landscape of jewelry CRM, discussing why it’s critical for businesses in 2025 and setting the stage for the top trends that will shape the industry’s future. The Digital Transformation of Luxury Retail The jewelry industry has undergone a significant transformation in recent years, shifting from traditional brick-and-mortar stores to omnichannel experiences.

Post-pandemic, customer expectations have changed drastically, with consumers demanding seamless online-offline integration in jewelry retail. A study by Bain & Company found that 60% of luxury consumers expect a personalized experience across all touchpoints, including online, social media, and in-store. To meet these expectations, jewelry retailers must invest in digital technologies, such as e-commerce platforms, social media, and data analytics tools, to create a cohesive and engaging customer experience. Digital adoption rates in luxury retail have increased by 30% since 2020, with online sales accounting for 20% of total sales in the jewelry industry. 80% of luxury consumers use social media to discover new brands and products, highlighting the importance of social media marketing in jewelry retail.

We here at SuperAGI have seen this trend firsthand, and are committed to helping jewelry retailers thrive in this new landscape. Why CRM is Critical for Jewelry Businesses in 2025 The jewelry retail industry presents a unique set of challenges, including high-value purchases, emotional significance, and long purchase cycles. These factors make it crucial for jewelry businesses to invest in sophisticated CRM systems that can help them build strong relationships with customers and drive long-term growth. According to a study by Bain & Company, customer retention rates in the jewelry sector are significantly lower than in other retail segments, with an average retention rate of 20-30% compared to 50-60% in other industries. However, when jewelry businesses are able to retain customers, the payoff can be substantial. A study by McKinsey & Company found that the lifetime value of a customer in the jewelry sector can be up to 5 times higher than in other retail segments. This highlights the importance of implementing effective CRM strategies to nurture customer relationships and encourage repeat business. To achieve this, jewelry businesses can leverage CRM systems to gain a deeper understanding of their customers’ preferences, behaviors, and purchase histories. By analyzing this data, businesses can create personalized marketing campaigns, offer tailored recommendations, and provide exceptional customer service. Some key statisti",

Post author:Nikhil Post published:April 2, 2025 Post category:Jewelry E-Commerce Reading time:4 mins read The jewelry industry is undergoing a digital transformation, with new e-commerce innovations reshaping how customers shop for fine jewelry online. From AI-driven product recommendations to augmented reality and virtual try-ons, brands are leveraging technology to enhance user experience and drive sales. Here are the latest trends defining jewelry e-commerce stores.1. Augmented Reality (AR) & Virtual Try-OnsShoppers can now virtually try on rings, necklaces, and bracelets using AR technology. This feature boosts confidence in purchasing high-value jewelry online and reduces return rates, making it a must-have for jewelry e-commerce platforms. AR try-ons allow customers to see how different pieces complement their outfits and skin tones in real time, creating a more interactive shopping experience. 2.

Customers can rotate and zoom into products to examine intricate details like gemstone clarity and metal finishing, helping them make more informed purchase decisions. 3. Live Shopping & Social CommerceBrands use live shopping events on social media to showcase jewelry collections, engage customers, and drive instant purchases. Social commerce for jewelry brands is now a key revenue channel. Live sessions allow viewers to ask questions, see product demonstrations, and make purchases directly from the platform, creating a more personal shopping experience.4. Subscription & Rental ModelsJewelry subscription services let customers receive curated pieces monthly. Luxury jewelry rental services are also rising, offering premium pieces without high upfront costs. This model appeals to customers who enjoy variety and access to high-end jewelry for special occasions, increasing customer loyalty and repeat business.5. Sustainable & Ethical JewelryShoppers prioritize sustainability, prompting brands to use ethically sourced gemstones, recycled metals, and eco-friendly packaging, aligning with the growing demand for sustainable jewelry. Brands are also adopting fair-trade practices and transparent supply chains to meet consumer expectations for responsible sourcing.6. Seamless Omnichannel ShoppingA unified experience across online and offline channels ensures convenience. Features like buy-online-pickup-in-store (BOPIS) and in-store appointments for jewelry purchases enhance flexibility and customer satisfaction. This helps customers easily switch between online browsing and in-person shopping without friction.7. Personalized Shopping with AIAI-powered recommendation engines analyze customer preferences, past purchases, and browsing behavior to offer personalised product suggestions. This enhances the shopping experience and increases conversions for jewelry e-commerce websites. AI helps stores predict trends, manage inventory better, and offer tailored discounts based on user behavior. 8.

From personalized recommendations to smart inventory forecasting, AI gives jewelry retailers a competitive edge—especially those working in fast-moving categories like stainless steel, fashion, and trend-driven pieces. Whether you operate a brick-and-mortar store or sell online, leveraging AI tools can dramatically increase your sales in 2025 and beyond. Let’s explore the most powerful AI strategies for retail jewelry brands and how to implement them. AI-Powered Virtual Try-On & Visual Tools Augmented reality and AI are changing the way customers shop for jewelry—especially online. By offering virtual try-on features, brands can build shopper confidence, increase engagement, and reduce returns. How Virtual Try-On Increases Jewelry Sales AI and AR-powered tools allow shoppers to \"try on\" rings, earrings, necklaces, and bracelets using just their smartphone or laptop camera. These tools use computer vision to detect facial features and hand shapes, rendering realistic previews of how pieces will look when worn. Not only do virtual try-ons reduce return rates, they also enhance conversion by making the experience more interactive. This is especially effective for trend-driven pieces like oversized hoops or statement necklaces—where visual appeal drives the purchase decision. Enhancing Product Visualization with AI Beyond virtual try-on, AI can generate 3D product visualizations that allow customers to rotate and zoom in on jewelry pieces. These features are crucial for fashion jewelry and stainless steel accessories where texture, shine, and styling are key selling points. Chatbots & AI-Powered Customer Support Exceptional customer service is a major driver of retail sales—and AI can help you deliver it at scale. Smart chatbots and AI-driven help desks can answer customer questions in real time, no matter the hour. 24/7 AI Chatbots for Retail Jewelry Stores AI chatbots are now sophisticated enough to handle inquiries about product details, shipping, sizing, and even style recommendations. This technology is especially useful for online wholesale jewelry brands where high product volume and frequent customer inquiries can strain human support teams. AI bots can help customers choose the right chain length, identify matching earrings, or resolve pre-sale concerns instantly—leading to more conversions with less friction. Sentiment Analysis & Post-Purchase Support AI can also analyze reviews, returns, and chat transcripts to detect patterns and common customer issues. Sentiment analysis allows brands to proactively fix problems, respond to negative experiences, and improve satisfaction—all of which help drive long-term sales. Predictive Analytics & Inventory Optimization Retail jewelry brands—especially wholesalers—need to manage stock levels carefully. AI predictive analytics help forecast demand, reduce overstock, and ensure top-selling items are always available. Forecasting Trends Before They Happen AI tools analyze customer behavior, historical sales, seasonal shifts, and even fashion trend data to anticipate future demand. For example, if AI detects growing interest in layered stainless steel necklaces or zodiac-themed charm bracelets, your team can increase orders and marketing efforts in advance. This demand forecasting reduces inventory waste and helps you stay ahead of seasonal trends—critical for success in fast-moving categories like fashion jewelry. Smarter Merchandising with AI Insights Clienteling tools powered by AI help retailers connect with past buyers by recommending products they're likely to purchase next. These tools allow in-store associates and e-commerce platforms to suggest products based on purchase history, preferences, and browsing behavior—leading to more personalized upsells and stronger customer loyalty. Personalized Marketing & Recommendation Engines Consumers expect personalization—and AI makes it scalable. From product recommendations to targeted email campaigns, AI lets you market the right product to the right customer at the right time. AI Product Recommendations That Drive Sales Recommendation engines analyze customer data—such as product views, abandoned carts, and wishlist activity—to suggest jewelry pieces that align with each shopper’s tastes. These tools can dynamically update homepage displays, shopping carts, or follow-up emails to boost conversion rates. A shopper who browses stainless steel rings in gold tones might be shown coordinating earrings or layered bracelets that complete the look. These relevant suggestions increase average order value and reduce bounce rates. AI Marketing in Action: A Real Retail Example Brands like Kendra Scott use AI “copilot” tools to ans",

Every week, a new AI tool emerges that either speeds up our workflow or completely changes the way we do things.There are still many unknowns about how AI will transform jewelry companies, but I already have a vision in mind - and we’re closer to it than most people would guess.If this vision comes true, it will radically reshape how jewelry businesses function today.The CAD/3D printing revolution: A Case Study in disruptionIf you had to guess, what recent technological breakthrough has already changed the way jewelry companies operate?My vote would go to 3D printing. With the rise of CAD and 3D printing, three major changes occurred:A whole profession - the hand wax carver - virtually disappeared. Between 2010 and 2015, CAD became fully accepted and widespread.CAD and 3D printing enabled designs that were previously unimaginable or extremely difficult to produce - revolutionizing the design process itself.Customers could now see a photorealistic image and 3D view of their jewelry before it was ever made. This later became a cornerstone of how we sell jewelry online.So - are you ready for the next big shift? I believe that AI-powered tools will offer design capabilities that the demand side of the market will very quickly adopt and embrace.How AI design tools will disrupt today’s custom jewelry workflowBut before I get into the details of my vision, let’s look at a few current assumptions:There’s a high demand for personalized, custom jewelry. That’s why everyone - from traditional retailers to online platforms - has focused on it. Just look at the rise of online jewelry configurators.The process of creating custom jewelry is time-consuming, from concept to final design. It often requires multiple rounds of consultation and approvals.An expert was traditionally needed to not only interpret what the customer wanted but also to provide a tailored price based on the design and production costs.This entire process is about to be disrupted by the new wave of generative AI tools.How generative AI changes the GameThe demand for personalized jewelry isn’t going away - but tools like BLNG AI, RhinoArtisan, and Gemist are set to transform the buying experience dramatically.Here is what Julie Henley, partner at Entrada Ventures - seed investor of Gemist - said:“Today’s consumers demand personalization, transparency, and beautiful digital experiences. Gemist delivers all three, empowering the jewelry industry to grow without adding operational complexity.” SourceWhat exactly do I predict with the rise of AI-assisted custom design?No more lengthy back-and-forth consultations to finalize a design. Customers will be able to do this themselves – online - guided by prompts or voice-based instructions.Instant virtual try-on will become mainstream. The tech has existed for a while, but it will truly take off when customers can try on their custom design immediately after creating it, using photorealistic renders.AI design tools will replace expensive, rigid configurators, offering dynamic experiences that adapt based on customer behavior - helping users co-create the perfect design.For those who still prefer in-store consultations, a full 3D model can be created by the end of the conversation.There will no longer be a need for an expert to calculate custom jewelry costs and pricing. This can be done automatically via API integrations and pricing algorithms, which also factor in each company's profit margins.Language-based AI systems will support customer education, empowering buyers to make smarter decisions. Consumer behavior will shift drastically - they’ll be hyper-optimized about what they spend money on.For example: once people realize they can request a lab-grown diamond with the same specs as a natural one, most will choose the former.Generative AI could also encourage more sustainable practices. By optimizing material use, reducing production waste, and encouraging lab-grown alternatives, AI could lower the industry's environmental footprint.We may even see the rise of full-scale jewelry manufacturers who accept direct orders from customers, weakening the role of retailers and wholesalers. Today, retailers still act as essential experts in the value chain - but soon, they may no longer be irreplaceable. Mini Case StudyImagine James, who wants a unique engagement ring. He uploads a sketch and describes his preferences using voice prompts. Within seconds, an AI tool generates several 3D options. He virtually simulates a try-on, adjusts the band width, and picks a lab-grown diamond - all before lunch. The system shows the final estimated price, confirms delivery in 12 days, and emails him a photorealistic render. No back-and-forth. No uncertainty.What Retailers and Designers must do nowAs with any disruption, there will be winners and losers. The key is to act early.But one thing is certain: the jewelry industry won’t be immune to the techno",

AI and AR technology. AT JCK Vegas, top jewelry brands are transforming the way customers interact with fine jewelry using virtual try-on experiences, digital product a showcase, and immersive personalization tools. Due to technological advancement and growing demand for convenience, personalization, and digital-first experiences, AI and AR innovations have taken center stage at the JCK show. So why exactly are brands investing heavily in these technologies? And how can your jewelry business ride the same wave of innovation? So, let’s delve into it and find out the role of AI and AR in the jewelry industry along with explore how it’s redefining the customer experience at the JCK jewelry show and beyond. What is AI and AR Technology in Jewelry? Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not something new, we all know about it from the last decade. However, if you don’t then let me explain. AI refers to a computer system that simulates human intelligence to perform tasks like visual recognition, decision making, and data analysis. In the jewelry space, AI helps brands in offering personalized recommendations, manage inventory smartly, and predict style trends based on consumer behavior. Augmented Reality (AR), on the other hand, blends digital content with the real world. In jewelry, AR allows customers to virtually try on jewellery such as rings, necklaces, bangles, and earrings try on through a mobile device or in-store mirrors. This interactive layer allows buyers to visualize how products look on them—anytime, anywhere. Together, AI and AR technology are driving the next evolution of jewelry retail—both online and offline. This offers a perfect mix of style, science, and smooth engagement. Use Case of AI and AR Technology ​ Top Jewlery brands at JCK Las Vegas are integrating AI nd AR across the entire customer journey. For instance: Virtual tryon platforms let shoppers see how a diamond necklace or a pair of earrings try on their face in real-time, limiting the guesswork about how it will look. AI-driven chatbots assist with product queries and offer personalized styling tips based on skin tone, face shape, and previous preferences. AR-powered store displays allow customers at JCK Vegas booths to explore full collections without touching a single piece of jewelry. Brands like Kendra Scott and DeBeers are already setting benchmarks by incorporating such features, gaining traction at every JCK show. Why is an AR Solution Important for Your Jewelry Brand? ​ According to research conducted by Engine Creative on AR solutions, this is what they find: 61% of customers say they prefer retailers with AR experience. 70% of shoppers are expected to be more loyal to brands offering AR interactions. AR can increase the conversion rates by up to 94%. Customers using AR are 3x more likely to engage with a product. With such promising numbers, it’s no surprise that JCK jewelry show exhibitors are embracing this tech revolution with open arms. Read More: Why You Need a Virtual Try-On for Your Jewellery eCommerce Website Increases Conversion ​ In the world of eCommerce, conversion is the topmost priority of any business. And AR has direct impact on boosting it. According to Shopify, brands who implemented AR features saw up to 94% higher conversion rate than those who don’t. With virtual try-on functionality, jewelry shoppers no longer hesitate. When they are more likely to hit the “Buy Now” button. Improved Customer Satisfaction AI and AR deliver personalization and interactivity—two key ingredients in customer satisfaction. A study by Deloitte highlights that 80% of consumers are more likely to purchase from brands that offer personalized experiences. AI algorithms can recommend matching sets, while AR lets users mix, match, and visualize pieces in real time. For example, a customer trying virtual try on jewellery might receive suggestions for complementary rings or bracelets based on face shape, previous interactions, or even seasonal trends. Lower Return Rates High return rates can cut deep into profits, especially for online jewelry sales where visual discrepancies are common. However, augmented reality helps bridge this gap. According to Retail Customer Experience, AR-driven retailers see 25% fewer returns compared to their non-AR competitors. Improve Brand Differentiation​ In a saturated market like the JCK jewelry show, brand differentiation is vital. Integrating AI and AR helps businesses stand out with innovation-led storytelling. According to Gartner, by 2025, 70% of enterprises will experinment with immersive technologies for consumer and enterprise use—and brands that move first have the ad",

    "extractedText": "Summary Mosaic helped a nationwide retailer model the price elasticity of demand across their product catalog, empowering them to optimize prices and maximize SKU revenue. Take Our Content to Go Introduction For retailers across the nation, predicting the effect that a change in sales price will have on demand is vital to optimizing prices and maximizing sales revenue. Without a reliable model, retailers rely on gut feel and Excel-based tools to answer critical questions such as: How much will sales increase if I drop my price by X% to get inventory out the door? How much will sales decrease if I increase my price by X% to avoid stock-outs? According to McKinsey, effectively and profitably linking pricing and promotions together using machine learning for retail pricing can increase revenue and profiles by three to five percentage points overall. In addition, companies that efficiently implement this approach often achieve improved customer satisfaction and loyalty. Mosaic helped a nationwide retailer answer these questions across their product catalog, a critical first step for their pricing team to optimize and standardize pricing across several thousand SKUs. The retailer was struggling with finding the right processes and tools to guide decisions on pricing. Mosaic matched the proper analytics tool and technique with their specific use case, delivering actionable predictive and prescriptive analytics regardless of the company’s level of analytics maturity. At every phase during the project, Mosaic acted as a true partner, collaborating effectively with the retailer to make sense of the observations uncovered in the data and the implications that certain estimates might have on the business. Mosaic interchanged data scientists with the team as requirements shifted, helping the firm set profitable prices while maintaining a consistent customer experience. Mosaic was critical in enabling the retailer to design & deploy machine learning for retail pricing. Price Elasticity of Demand The key economic law underpinning this modeling effort is the price elasticity of demand. This is a measurement of the estimated change in demand in relation to a change in price. If the price changes by X%, the elasticity coefficient is the percentage by which we expect demand to change as a response. Here is how the price elasticity of demand is expressed mathematically: Where the elasticity coefficient θ is equal to the change in demand q divided by the change in price p. For example: If price increases by 20% and demand drops by 10%, elasticity coefficient is -10/20 = -0.50 If price decreases by 20% and demand increases by 10%, elasticity is also -0.50 Economists assume that elasticity is linear and that the coefficient is constant across all price changes. Elasticity coefficients are typically negative values and will vary depending on the product in question. Some products are more elastic than others. For example, a grande triple pumpkin spice soy macchiato is more elastic than gas because when inflation goes up, gas is more essential. Examples of factors that affect the price elasticity of demand for a product are: Necessity: The more necessary a product is, the lower the elasticity. This implies that even large increases in price will result in small decreases in demand. Substitutability: Elasticity will be higher if more substitutes are available. For example, large increases in price will result in large decreases in demand because consumers have other options. Brand loyalty: Where consumers are attached to a particular brand, elasticity tends to be lower because consumers are still willing to buy a product even if the price increases. Duration: If a higher price holds for a long time, consumers tend to accept the new price, resulting in less elastic demand. Income effect: The higher the percentage of a consumer’s income relative to a product’s price, the higher the elasticity typically is. The more negligible the price change is relative to income, the less elastic it is. Breadth of definition: The broader the definition of a good or service, the lower the elasticity tends to be. For example, food in general is not very elastic, while specific types of food may be more elastic (e.g. seafood) because consumers have other options. Addictiveness: Goods that are more addictive tend to be less elastic. This relates to necessity because consumers who are addicted to cigarettes treat them as necessary. Payer: When the consumer does not directly pay for a good (e.g. corporate expense accounts), demand is typically less elastic. For example, a price hike at a high-end restaurant will be negligible if the consumer pays for the meal with a company card. Price Elasticity of Demand Modeling Mosaic engaged with a nationwide retailer to deliver models using machine learning for retail pricing that would determine price elasticity of demand across their product catalog. Here we describe the high-level approach taken to develop these",

The difficult issue of striking the correct balance between affordability and profitability is one that merchants must constantly manage. Pricing strategies are now more complicated than ever because of the growth of e-commerce and rising competition. Fortunately, artificial intelligence (AI) can assist merchants in maintaining their competitiveness and improving their pricing tactics. AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data, including customer behavior, competitor pricing, inventory levels, and market trends, to provide retailers with insights and recommendations for pricing. In this article, we will explore how AI can help retailers stay competitive in the ever-changing landscape of retail pricing. COVID-19: Retail-Accelerated AI The COVID-19 epidemic has had a significant influence on the retail sector and has significantly sped up the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in the sector. With customers increasingly turning to e-commerce in the face of lockdowns and social isolation measures, the move toward online purchasing that started before the outbreak has been further accelerated. As a result, merchants are now under pressure to swiftly modify their business practices to satisfy customers’ shifting needs, and AI has become a crucial instrument in this process. According to a recent survey by Salesforce, 71% of retail executives believe that the pandemic has accelerated their company’s digital transformation by an average of three years. This has led to a surge in investment in AI technologies, as retailers look to improve their e-commerce operations, personalize shopping experiences, and better manage their inventory. Another survey by McKinsey & Company found that 72% of retailers have increased their investment in AI since the start of the pandemic, with a focus on areas such as chatbots and virtual assistants, predictive analytics, and automated supply chain management. These investments have already begun to pay off, with retail companies reporting improved customer satisfaction, increased sales, and reduced operational costs as a result of their AI implementation. What price optimization means ? Setting the best possible price for a good or service in order to maximize profits is called price optimization. Finding the right balance between pricing a product high enough to maximize profits and low enough to draw customers and maintain market competitiveness is the aim of price optimization.To find the best price for a product, one must analyze a number of variables, including manufacturing costs, customer demand, competitor pricing, and market trends. With the ability to analyze massive volumes of data and uncover patterns and trends that may be utilized to improve pricing, advanced analytics tools, and techniques, such as machine learning and data analysis, are frequently employed in this process.Price optimization is a continuous process, though, because customer tastes and market conditions can change over time. In order to stay competitive, companies must constantly review and modify their pricing strategy. Methods and techniques that retailers can use to leverage AI and improve their pricing strategies By leveraging AI, retailers can analyze vast amounts of data and gain insights into consumer behavior and market trends that were previously impossible to obtain: 1- Dynamic Pricing Dynamic pricing is one of the most often used uses of AI in pricing methods. Dynamic pricing entails altering prices in real time in response to a variety of variables, including competition, demand, and even weather patterns. Retailers can always determine the best pricing for their items by employing AI algorithms to examine data from numerous sources.For example, Amazon uses dynamic pricing to adjust prices on its products several times a day based on factors such as competitor pricing, sales volume, and demand. This allows them to remain competitive while maximizing profits. 2- Predictive Analytics Predictive analytics is another effective w",

Many retailers scrape rivals’ websites for price information and use it to set their own prices manually or automatically, often using a strategy of charging X dollars or X percent less than the lowest-price competitor. However, retailers that use such simple heuristics miss significant opportunities because they fail to tailor their responses to product availability and demand, among other factors.Read more on Pricing strategy or related topics AI and machine learning, Algorithms, Strategy, Experimentation, Consumer behavior and Retail and consumer goodsA version of this article appeared in the November–December 2023 issue of Harvard Business Review.MFMarshall Fisher is the UPS Professor in the Operations, Information, and Decisions Department of the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School and a codirector of the school’s Fishman-Davidson Center for Service and Operations Management.Santiago Gallino is the Charles W.

A period of global market volatilities and record-high inflation is creating retail pricing’s most stubborn headache, occurring at the same time as its largest opportunity for advancement: Seismic leaps in AI, machine learning, and automation. After adjustments for inflation, only 52% of companies across 13 industries and 19 countries expect real revenue growth in 2023 – the lowest number in decades. In essence, retail and branded goods pricing today is a reflection of what is going on in the world. How are consumers and retail leaders alike dealing with and responding to these trends? How can brands and retailers keep their heads above water? In this article, we will discuss key trends affecting retail pricing, e-commerce, and consumer behaviour, and will offer vendors tried-and-tested pricing and commercial strategies. Market volatility: Inflation, food and gas increases, and consumer suffering For consumers and businesses alike, inflation seems to be the waterproof mascara of the retail industry – hanging on a little too long and doing its job a little too effectively. Europe began 2022 with 5.8% inflation in February, which only increased throughout the year to 9.1% in August. Simultaneously, the UK experienced a 40-year record-high of 10.1% inflation in mid-2022, while in the US, the average inflation rate sat at 6.5% for the year. Even as we enter the second half of 2023, retail pricing is still feeling the effects as brands and retailers maintain higher prices to offset the cost of inflation. Gas prices in Europe increased by 150% between July 2021 - 2022, while food costs are sitting 17% higher in April 2023 versus the year earlier. In Germany alone, cheese increased by 40%, according to the country’s Federal Statistical Office. As food and energy costs remain high and barely manageable, consumer suffering has resulted in more conservative spending and a shift to less expensive brands. Most notably, high- and low-income households are both cutting down on spending, with spending growth from high-income shoppers sitting at -3% for two months in a row, May and June, for the first time in two years. Retail pricing increases in Europe, as of April 2023 Source: Eurostat 2023. Year-over-year changes in EU food price inflation vsthe United Nations global food commodity price index: Source: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Eurostat. This change in consumer behaviour, coupled with stubborn inflation, has created a deadlock for retail pricing beyond food. Brands and retailers can’t afford to decrease prices without suffering significant losses. At the same time, consumers aren’t able to maintain the same spending habits they were used to before inflation became a consistent reality in the shopping cart. Consequently, brands and retailers need to react in creative ways to fuel growth and stay profitable. For this, we have identified three levers to succeed under these difficult market circumstances. Talk to one of our consultants about dynamic pricing. Contact us Talk to one of our consultants about dynamic pricing. Pricing Innovation: Digitalisation of pricing and the development of dynamic competition Dynamic pricing is not as established as the industry of pricing itself. Set pricing without haggling or bargaining first occurred in the late 1800s when a shop owner, John Wanamaker, placed a price tag on an item in Philadelphia, USA. Implementing a pricing strategy and tracking price changes has largely been a manual task with some form of a digital blueprint or spreadsheet to keep track. Today, the convergence of the availability of large data volumes at a decent quality, fast computer processing power, and, ultimately, advanced analytics and AI have made it possible to apply dynamic pricing automatically at high speed. Today, dynamic pricing is not just used in airlines or hotels but also in e-commerce and online retail. According to a June 2023 study conducted by Horváth, using digitalisation to boost efficiency in areas like pricing processes was at the top of the list of industry-specific needs, with 55% agreeing that it would have a high impact, showing just how effective dynamic pricing has become. In addition, Horváth found that 30% agreed that implementing AI in business rules would also have a high impact. There are various pricing strategies brands can implement to improve profits, increase market share, and strengthen customer relationships. The beauty of dynamic pricing is that it can bring together all these different strategies at once w",

The office lights dimmed when I powered up my computer. So, I sympathize with today’s category managers who are still mired in spreadsheets or outdated planning systems. Inaccuracies and inefficiencies are baked into the very processes they use to manage their retail pricing strategies. These processes can’t handle the requirements and scale of retail data analysis, no matter how heroically teams maintain their files. The good news is that pricing solutions have advanced far beyond formulas and data tables teetering on the edge of breaking every time someone uses the office microwave. AI-driven retail price optimization solutions now integrate, process, and analyze data from across the organization in near real-time. This level of visibility and control gives retailers the rapid insights they need to effectively manage pricing decisions across locations, categories, and banners – every week. Let’s explore how the right solution helps companies determine and execute optimal retail pricing strategies that protect margins, maintain a competitive price image, and increase customer satisfaction. Types of retail pricing strategies A pricing strategy determines how a product will be priced to achieve a particular KPI. Before we talk about implementing a strategy, let’s consider our options. There are five standard retail pricing strategies. Preserving the status quo: Often, for main stake products, retailers prefer to maintain revenue and margin levels. They’re not looking to make big changes that could upset the balance of demand for that product. Gaining incremental margin wins: In the convenience category, retailers may risk slightly wider margins, but they keep that risk to a minimum to avoid alienating customers. Maximizing margins: Your margin enhancers are products that allow you to significantly improve margins without negatively affecting demand or price image. Protecting your territory: In some cases, it’s worth pricing certain products somewhat aggressively, even to the slight detriment of your margins, if it means gaining an edge over the competition. Staying competitive – even if it costs you: Sometimes, competitors offer such low prices on specific items, you need to match them just to get customers through the door. Highly aggressive pricing may significantly shrink your margin on that product, but it’s worth it to protect your price image and increase traffic. So now you have an array of strategies. How do you decide which strategy to apply to each product? The challenges of selecting a strategy and the dangers of getting it wrong There’s a lot at stake when designing a retail strategy. A poor strategy can create inventory inefficiencies, erode margins, reduce your competitiveness, and damage customer trust. You’ll have to wade through a lot of considerations and data before you can determine which pricing strategy best fits each product, category, location, and season. Fig. 1: When developing pricing strategies, retailers must balance factors like price elasticity, price image, and competitor activities, often while contending with disruptions and internal issues like large datasets and asynchronous planning. Data, data everywhere, but we don’t know what to think To determine the impact pricing decisions have on demand, retailers must gather enormous volumes of data from multiple sources and then store, process, and analyze that data to make effective decisions. Plus, as a retailer, you may have 100 categories, multiplied by five banners, available in five different pricing regions. That’s a lot of input to analyze, often on a very tight schedule. Most planning processes cannot handle and organize this flow of information at the rate the industry moves. Without a system that creates a cohesive picture of data at a granular, product-specific level, retailers won’t have the insights and visibility to plan efficiently, meet demand, and achieve margin targets. Determining price elasticity Price elasticity refers to how drastically changes in price affect demand – a key consideration when devising a strategy. Products that experience significant demand fluctuations in response to price changes are considered highly “elastic.” For example, if you put non-essential treats on sale – cookies, candy, chips – you’ll likely see a spike in demand as people stock up on their favorites. Other products – usually staples like bread or milk – are “inelastic.” Demand for these products remains the same, regardless of price. If you raise the price of milk, consumers will likely still pay it because they consider milk a necessity. If you run a promotion, it probably won’t make a significant difference, e",

This time, we will shift our focus on how machine learning systems can elevate the retail industry, focusing on practical use cases that benefit the companies in 2024.According to the report by Cognitive Market Research, the global Artificial Intelligence market was valued at USD 4951.2 million in 2023 and is expected to grow with a CAGR of 31.4% in a period from 2024 to 2031. While other subdivisions of Artificial Intelligence, like deep learning in retail, are a big part of it, still it’s hard to overestimate the significance of machine learning here.Why Using Machine Learning Is Crucial for Modern Retail BusinessesThe retail industry’s future is being shaped by the evolution of AI and ML capabilities as they influence every aspect of it, from inventory management to customer interactions. These technologies are no longer optional for businesses seeking to stay competitive, and below we describe why.Staying Competitive in a Highly Saturated MarketIntroducing ML in retail operations means enabling algorithms to sift through massive amounts of data and offer discoveries about trends, patterns, and customer insights. Based on these findings, retailers get the chance to refine product assortments, tailor marketing campaigns, and deliver personalized customer experiences. Equipped with this capability, retail companies can act on real-time data and align strategies with consumer choices.Maximizing Profit Margins Amid Rising Operational CostsWhile operational expenses connected to supply chain disruptions to labor cost are escalating, ML becomes essential in pinpointing inefficiencies and optimizing resource allocation. The most powerful asset ML introduces here is predictive analytics. With it, retailers can forecast demand with greater accuracy, strategically plan inventory, or set up dynamic pricing – all to squeeze the most value out of every investment and minimize wasteful spending. Adapting to Rapid Changes in Consumer TrendsConsumer preferences can change almost overnight due to factors like social media influences, cultural shifts, or economic fluctuations. However, ML allows retailers to quickly grasp these changes by constantly monitoring data streams. In this manner, algorithms spot consumer behavior (feedback, point-of-sale metrics, interaction with the retail website) and analyze them. Retailers, in turn, can respond to these trends by adjusting their offerings in real time. 15 Advanced Applications of Machine Learning in RetailFrom catering to customer satisfaction to ensuring stronger security measures, ML in retail covers an array of use cases.1. Personalized RecommendationsAccording to a survey by Exploding Topics, 60% of consumers say they’ll become repeat customers after receiving a personalized shopping experience, and machine learning can be a great help with this. For over 25 years, Amazon has been a prime example of this use case with their recommendation algorithm and during these decades, they improved upon their solution, setting a great example for the retail sector. Their system leverages various machine learning algorithms to analyze customers’ browsing and purchase history, along with other data points, to deliver highly accurate product recommendations. The core techniques they use include collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, as well as hybrid models. This recommendation algorithm brings the company several benefits, including:Boosted sales, as a result of encouraging users to discover and purchase additional products.Increased customer satisfaction due to catering to individual needs. More efficient inventory and supply chain management, as Amazon can anticipate the demand patterns of popular products.2. Customer SegmentationThis essential marketing process of dividing a customer base into distinct groups that share similar characteristics can be dramatically improved by utilizing powerful machine learning algorithms. With the capabilities of machine learning, it is possible to analyze large datasets and detect hidden patterns that may not be visible to human experts, quite similarly to how eCommerce fraud detection works. A notable example in this category is software by Optimove. Their solution uses all available sales data and employs complex clustering models to perform advanced customer segmentation. The technology results in many finely sliced micro-segments and in addition to that, a solution by Optimove recalculates the segmentation of every customer and tracks how customers move from one micro-segment to another over time.3. Demand ForecastingThis is a critical aspect of any business in the retail industry, and combined with machine learning, anticipating future demand can be more accurate than ever.

We explore the current landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) within pricing strategies, as well as the technology’s overarching advantages in regard to pricing. We aim to understand the principal obstacles encountered when harnessing AI within pricing strategies and propose strategies for retailers looking to mitigate these challenges. Our analysis is informed by a recent Coresight Research survey of 150 retail business decision-makers in the US, conducted by Coresight Research on February 1–2, 2024. Market Scale and Opportunity The global retail pricing optimization software market is poised for significant growth, reflecting the retail sector’s increased reliance on technology for product pricing amid economic volatility. Coresight Research estimates that the market will total $1.6 billion in 2024 and grow at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 16.5% between 2023 and 2028. The US holds the largest market share, at 51.0% (as of 2023), and is set to grow at a significant 14.8% CAGR between 2023 and 2028, with its market share totaling $1.4 billion.

AI-Informed Pricing Decisions Are Prevalent Among Retailers Our survey found that an overwhelming majority — 92% of respondents — stated that they use an AI-based pricing solution to inform their pricing decisions. We then asked those who are currently using an AI-based pricing solution whether they have benefited from that AI-based pricing solution and found that all respondents have benefited at least “slightly.” Leveraging AI Can Be Cumbersome and Challenging While AI is prevalently used in pricing strategies and its benefits are well-known, the level of sophistication and integration varies across organizations. It can be challenging for companies to leverage an advanced AI-based pricing solution primarily due to the inputs that the algorithm requires to produce robust results. The three most widely cited challenges in leveraging AI for pricing are: a lack of integration with key complementary business functions (e.g., promotion planning); a lack of trust around AI models; and limited integration capabilities with company-wide solutions. Integrated Business Functions and Real-Time Pricing Amplify AI-Based Pricing Benefits The current state of pricing strategies and the level of integration between pricing and complementary business functions underline the underutilization of technology and a lack of sophisticated tech use. Our survey revealed that, on average, only 41% of respondents stated they have “fully integrated” their price planning strategies with the five complementary business functions we surveyed about. Examining the data by company size reveals that the opportunity is even more pressing for retailers earning less than $1 billion in total sales — only 37% of respondents from this group, on average, cited full integration across key business functions. We asked those respondents currently leveraging an AI-based pricing solution about the method they are using to inform pricing decisions and found real-time pricing has huge growth potential, with only 56% of respondents currently using real-time pricing. Outlook on AI Usage and Investments Reveals Upbeat Retailer Sentiment We asked those currently leveraging AI-based pricing solutions whether they plan to increase investments in AI-based pricing solutions in the coming 12 months: 97% of respondents stated that they plan to increase those investments in the coming year. We then asked respondents about which differentiators would cause them to pick one AI-based pricing solution over another. Our results found that the most influential differentiators were those that supported retailers’ integration goals — especially integration with key complementary business functions and with company-wide solutions. What We Think An effective pricing strategy can often be a leading driver of profits and provide an edge over the competition. Currently, there is prevalent use of AI-based pricing software in the US market and various major retailers, including Best Buy, Kroger and Macy’s, have recently highlig",

Futuristic, modern technologies are taking over. Luxury brands must follow to keep up with customer satisfaction. AI technology can offer many benefits in terms of marketing and the customer experience. Not only can it allow business processes to run smoother, it can also take the guesswork out of marketing initiatives. It tracks exactly what customers shop for when browsing a business’s products. This helps to streamline marketing efforts and better control inventory. Learn more about how AI technology is changing the world of luxury retail. How is AI used in luxury retail? AI-powered technology has made headlines in recent news—and it’s not predicted to stop there. It has changed the way many industries work, including the luxury goods industry. Luxury shoppers need an amplified experience. That means businesses must keep up to meet their demands. AI technology can be an excellent tool for catering to those who shop in the luxury market. How? Let’s look at some examples. How has AI improved the customer experience in luxury retail? Luxury retail brands are already using AI in a variety of ways to improve the front-end customer journey. More Personalized Experiences Dior and Louis Vuitton are using AI-enabled chatbots to connect with customers at scale in a way that still looks like natural language, including the use of emojis. This means they can provide more personalized experiences across more customers with less manual effort. L’Occitane is using machine learning to provide customers with personalized experiences, including personalized product recommendations. This not only provides customers with a highly curated experience, but also increases conversion rates and boosts sales. Creative Campaigns that Connect Brands like Moncler, Zegna, and Valentino have started using AI to create campaigns. Blending AI-generated content with human creativity to create the kind of new brand experiences that luxury customers crave. Interactive Online Brand Experiences Sephora uses Modiface AI technology to power their online Visual Artist. This virtual makeup experience lets customers upload a photo of themselves so they can “try on” makeup to see how different products will look on them. Not only does this offer customers a fun and interactive brand experience they’re likely to share with friends, it boosts online sales by removing the risk of buying a color you haven’t tried on in person. Deeper Customer Insights Prada Group is using AI to gain deeper insights into their customers. These insights enable them to deliver high-quality content faster across a range of multi-channel communications. Once again, driving increased sales. But the benefits of AI are not limited to front-end customer experiences. How can AI improve operational efficiencies in luxury retail? There are several ways in which AI can drive operational efficiencies. Burberry is using AI for image analysis to identify counterfeit products. They use machine learning to analyze millions of images and identify subtle irregularities and inconsistencies in product properties (like size, shape, color, texture, and angles) so they can identify which products are genuine and which are fake. Ralph Lauren is using AI across many different business functions for tasks like copy editing, graphics, and code generation. Improved Demand Forecasting Some ecommerce search engines, like Constructor, now provide AI-driven product attribute enrichment tools. Why are they important? These tools help improve product discovery and the relevance of search results. They can also be used to enable AI-generated product descriptions. While these AI-generated descriptions may need to be edited for a luxury audience, using AI can reduce the effort required, thereby increasing the efficiency of product information managers. What’s more, having a lot of defined product attributes for each item you sell has another benefit: Improving demand forecast accuracy. Especially for predicting demand for products without any historical sales data—which is often the case for seasonal items. Traditionally, very large sets of product attributes have only been created for commoditized products that don’t change often due to the effort involved. But now, AI tools easily enable the creation of product attributes, making AI-driven demand forecast accuracy a more viable approach, even for seasonal items. Brands that invest in attribute enhancement will be in the best position to take full advantage of AI-driven demand forecasting solutions, like Relex and Toolsgroup. What other data can be used to increase AI-driven demand forecast accuracy? Digital demand signals. For example, the number of times a customer checks if an item variant (e.g., in a particular size / color combination) is in stock vs. the number of orders for that item. Which is",

Ellie Jin 6-min. read This article was originally published by members of the Wilson College of Textiles’ Fashion Textile and Business Excellence Cooperative. Nearly every industry is poised to undergo an unprecedented transformation with the introduction of artificial intelligence (AI). AI, in simple terms, refers to technology, often in the form of computer programs, designed to replicate the human brain’s ability to perform tasks and continuously improve. Generative AI, powered by deep learning algorithms, is making a significant impact on fashion brands. This advanced technology has the capacity to comprehend patterns within data and generate entirely new examples of text, images and even video (Bain, 2023). Because of its ability to create new content, the fashion industry is integrating its technology into nearly all of its processes in some way, from design and product descriptions to product recommendations and 3D design (Mcdowell, 2023a). Table 1 provides a few real-world examples of how AI is already being used in the industry. Table 1. Applications of Generative AI in the Fashion Industry CategoryHow it worksExampleFashion Design• Transforms textual descriptions or uploaded images into illustrations• Adjusts these designs before production• Cala’s tool with DALL-E technology • Tommy Hilfiger’s AI-Assisted Design Collaboration with IBM and the Fashion Institute of Technology• Project Muze by Google and ZalandoVisual Content and Marketing Imagery• Generates advertising and marketing content using given parameters or inputs • Text, images and videos are common outputs• Stitch Fix’s AI visuals• Casablanca’s Spring/Summer 2023 campaign• Revolve’s AI-driven ad campaignCopywriting• Generates copy based on keywords and instructions provided by the user • Streamlines the process of creating product descriptions, marketing emails and other written content• Adore Me’s AI optimization• Product descriptions for Search Engine Optimization (SEO)Shopping Assistants• Utilizes natural language processing to interact with customers as chatbots• Offers product recommendations and provides information• Kering’s experimental KNXT platform• Luxury personal shopper powered by ChatGPT AI in design Generative AI has the power to revolutionize fashion design. Designers can harness AI image generators like DALL-E, Midjourney or Stable Diffusion to bring their creative visions to life. Cala, a supply chain startup, was the first group to harness AI in the design creation process for fashion brands. In January 2023 it introduced a tool that allows users to describe their design ideas in text or upload images which AI will then transform into illustrations or realistic images. Users can then fine tune these designs before turning them into physical products. This tool marks a pioneering use of the DALL-E API in the fashion industry, enabling the creation of clothing, accessories, shoes and lifestyle products based on descriptions or images (OpenAI, 2022). RelatedLearn more about AI with the FTBEC In August 2024, the Wilson College of Textiles’ Fashion and Textile Business Excellence Cooperative will host AI in the Textile and Fashion Industries: an in-person conference for industry professionals.Learn more and register Apparel brands are also leveraging this technology. Tommy Hilfiger collaborated with IBM and the Fashion Institute of Technology on a project named Reimagine Retail. This initiative aimed to give retailers a competitive advantage in the speed of forecasting emerging design trends by analyzing a vast array of data from images and fabrics to colors (Saunders, 2019). While generative AI empowers designers to explore new concepts and ideas rapidly by generating various design variations, there are limitations to the technology. Manual editing and adjustments are often necessary as AI cannot turn all concepts into finished products. Concerns regarding intellectual property may also arise as some AI-generated designs could be based on copyrighted work. Legal issues in this area are still evolving, prompting brands to involve their legal teams and establish guidelines (Bain, 2023). AI in Copywriting: Efficiency and personalization Generative AI tools are serving as valuable assistants to marketing teams, streamlining the writing process for product descriptions and marketing emails. Copywriters input keywords and instructions and AI generates copy that can be edited as needed, enabling brands to produce written content more efficiently. The lingerie brand Adore Me has been using AI tools to optimize product descriptions for Search Engine Optimization (SEO) to make them more likely to appear at the top of search engine results (Mcdowell, 2023a). Adore Me and other brands using AI this way report dozens of hours in time savings. Using AI’s potential to personalize content at a one-to-one level requires businesses to",

As tools become more advanced and trusted across different use cases in everyday life, more consumers will adopt AI for shopping. 23 percent of consumers primarily use generative AI to discover products, while the majority still use traditional search.Though still comparatively small, shopping-related generative AI searches grew 4,700 percent between July 2024 and July 2025, with AI supporting inspiration and product comparison — especially helpful in the fashion category where choice abounds. This is impacting brands’ traffic sources. According to SimilarWeb, ChatGPT accounted for 16 percent of Zara’s and 8 percent of H&M and Aritzia’s inbound traffic between June and August 2025. 53 percent of US consumers who used generative AI for search inQ2 2025 also used it to help them shop.Unlike paid ads which are clearly sponsored, over 40 percent of consumers say AI responses feel more reliable, while only 15 percent consider them less reliable. Shoppers are therefore increasingly willing to make purchases from AI-based recommendations, as seen in the 84 percent growth in AI-driven revenue per visit on US retail sites between January and July 2025. 41 percent of consumers say they trust generative AI search results more than paid search ads.Technical improvements, such as reduced hallucinations (where a model generates incorrect, misleading or nonsensical information), combined with access to consumer behavioural data are making generative AI more reliable and user-friendly. These models provide more relevant recommendations, reduce search friction and build consumer confidence as the algorithm learns and improves over time. 85 percent of US consumers that use generative AI for shopping say they have a better experience than traditional methods.ADVERTISEMENTGenerative engine optimisation is becoming an essential add-on to search engine optimisationGenerative engine optimisation (GEO) is fast becoming a critical counterpart to search engine optimisation (SEO) as AI’s role in product discovery continues to grow.GEO ensures content is visible to and optimised for generative AI models. Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity and Gemini respond to consumer search queries by providing conversational, synthesised and structured answers rather than ranked lists of links. To appear in answers, website content must be easily read, contextualised and considered credible by the AI. GEO focuses on optimising content such as products listings to be just that, with early movers like Estée Lauder Companies, L’Oréal and Mejuri experimenting with GEO.Bettered-structured content is more likely to be surfaced by AI. Making content visible and easy to pick up means showing up in more places (different channels, languages, platforms) and making sure the basics are done right — like clear product titles, descriptions and metadata tags (descriptive data labels that help AI tools understand and surface products). Reviews, blogs and partnerships are also powerful signals that AI tools use to judge trustworthiness that brands should amplify.Brands and retailers should tackle GEO alongside SEO. Traditional search, including paid and organic, still drives most search traffic. (Bing alone accounts for 4 percent of global search volume, more than all generative AI platforms combined.) Overlooking either GEO or SEO risks leaving critical gaps in visibility.In the years ahead, consumers could rely on autonomous AI agents to help them shopAdvances in AI are opening the door to autonomous agents that act on behalf of consumers and businesses. These agents could streamline journeys by condensing multiple steps into a single action.While still nascent, agentic AI has the potential to fundamentally transform digital commerce, taking on the role of intermediary between brand and consumer, like retailers and marketplaces today. With AI simplifying product comparisons, brand loyalty will become even more important in purchase decisions. Brands should double down on retention tactics to build the emotional resonance that will influence consumers’ choices.The technologies that would allow agents to transact on someone’s behalf remain in development. As they mature, agentic AI models may either integrate into existing e-commerce ecosystems or create entirely new channels of discovery and purchase, reshaping how brands both market and sell their products.Some AI players are already testing these models. For example, OpenAI struck deals with Shopify and Etsy to let shoppers buy products from those platforms directly in ChatGPT, while Amazon’s “Buy for Me” lets consumers buy from third-party platforms within the Amazon app.ADVERTISE",

    "extractedText": " Category Digital Transformation, Fashion, Retail The fashion industry has always been at the forefront of creativity, setting trends and redefining aesthetics. Today, technology is disrupting how fashion retail operates, from inventory management to personalized shopping experiences. As consumer demands evolve, innovation is no longer optional; it’s essential for business survival. The Role of Technology in Fashion Retail AI and AR have emerged as game changers in fashion retail. AI-powered tools like virtual stylists and chatbots enhance customer service, while AR enables virtual try-ons, allowing customers to visualize outfits without stepping into a store. Examples of virtual Try-On Solution Tools like AR mirrors and apps bridge the gap between online and in-store shopping. Customers can \"try on\" clothes virtually, ensuring a perfect fit and reducing return rates. Examples of AI-Powered Personalization Retailers like ZARA and H&M use AI algorithms to suggest outfits based on browsing history and personal style, delivering hyper-personalized shopping experiences. E-Commerce and Omnichannel Retail 1. The Power of Omnichannel Strategies In the age of multichannel shopping, fashion retailers are integrating physical stores, websites, and mobile apps for seamless customer journeys.

    "extractedText": "Artificial intelligence has seemingly raised the barriers to ecommerce success. The industry has long been a David-and-Goliath tale. In theory, anyone with a product and an internet connection could compete with retail giants. AI arguably reinforces this underdog story. The tools are certainly accessible. Generative AI has dramatically lowered the cost of producing content such as product descriptions, articles, images, and videos. AI appears to make small businesses more competitive. Generative AI makes creating content fast and easy. For example, Nano Banana Pro generated this image. AI Divide But what if AI is creating a divide? AI is universally available, but does every business have the ability to employ it? On the one hand, there are enterprises and digital-native retail and direct-to-consumer giants that use AI for supply chain forecasting, dynamic pricing, and other essential tasks. With money and engineering talent, these merchants are creating a reinforcing efficiency loop. Some have direct relationships with OpenAI, Perplexity, and Google for AI shopping integrations and data access. On the other hand, imagine an entrepreneur launching an ecommerce shop from her garage. She lacks the infrastructure and expertise to deploy AI at scale. The divide is already visible in how AI shapes discovery, relevance, and shopping behavior. Zero Clicks AI-driven “zero-click” search may be the most immediate threat for small-to-midsize ecommerce businesses. Until recently, search results sent users to websites. Long-tail discovery — “best hiking boots for wide feet,” for example — was often a lifeline for SMBs. A well-written buying guide or blog post could rank, attract readers, build trust, and generate sales. AI has broken that model. Google’s AI Overviews and emerging genAI platforms answer product questions directly on the results page. Summarized recommendations, feature lists, and comparisons don’t require a click. Invisibility Worse still, when recommending products, AI models rely on “trusted” sources, with indicators such as domain age, traffic history, structured data, reviews, and brand mentions across the web. Large retailers have mastered these inputs for years. They operate teams dedicated to Schema.org markup, catalog hygiene, and feed optimization. The result is relatively cleaner, richer signals that AI systems treat as authoritative. An SMB may produce excellent content or even have a superior product, but remain invisible. The business could once rank on page one for a narrow niche query if competition was light. AI answers eliminate that opportunity. If it doesn’t “see” the new site, the model never recommends it. This invisibility is structural, not punitive. AI search rewards incumbents whose data footprints already saturate the web. Put another way, the advantages enterprise retailers have long enjoyed in organic search are magnified in large language models. Agentic Shopping A second shift is emerging as AI agents participate in the buying process. Agentic commerce refers to systems that search, compare, evaluate, and even purchase products on behalf of users. Major AI firms are piloting these capabilities and partnerships. Large retailers and marketplaces have formed direct integrations. Some enterprise merchants provide verified product data to OpenAI for shopping recommendations. Others collaborate with Perplexity to enrich AI answers with structured product feeds. Amazon and Walmart each have internal AI agents that evaluate catalog content and surface products across their owned channels. Such integrations give enterprise retailers a privileged position in agentic commerce. Their data is clean, complete, and constantly refreshed. Their catalogs include millions of SKUs. Their fulfillment networks provide real-time availability. SMBs Yet traditional organic search has not always ranked ecommerce SMBs. Marketplaces, social media, affiliates, and even direct mail have long been more productive for many sellers. Small-budget advertising remains accessible via Google, Bing, Amazon, Walmart, Meta, and, soon, the LLMs themselves, none of which are remotely profitable. Look for SMB heavyweights such as Shopify, Etsy, Stripe, and PayPal to continue collaboration efforts with the genAI platforms. Already, providers such as ReFiBuy and others offer generative engine optimization services — GEO — recognizing the opportunity to serve smaller companies. The internet was once deemed a threat to independent stores. That didn’t happen. David has beaten Goliath before.",

TABLE OF CONTENTS Key Takeaways 7 Benefits of AI in Online Retail How AI Enhances eCommerce Experiences Top AI Tools for eCommerce Platforms Implementation Best Practices Final Thoughts: Should You Invest Now? FAQs About AI for eCommerce 7 Benefits of AI in Online Retail The growing presence of AI in eCommerce is not just keeping up with technology trends, it’s also about having the business advantage. By combining automated data analytics and advanced algorithms, AI empowers online businesses to meet expectations faster, more innovative, and more effectively. Hyper-Personalized Customer Experiences AI can analyze real-time data to deliver tailored product recommendations, personalized emails, and dynamic landing pages. This includes browsing history, past purchases, and demographic details. In fact, Salesforce reports that 73% of consumers say treating them like an individual rather than a number is key to winning loyalty. This level of personalization increases engagement, average order value (AOV), and customer loyalty. 24/7 Intelligent Customer Support According to CX Today, Gartner predicted that AI-powered support can resolve up to 80% of common customer queries without human intervention. AI chatbots and virtual assistants handle common inquiries, such as order tracking, return policies, and product details, around the clock. This reduces response time from hours to seconds and frees up human agents for complex issues. Smarter Inventory and Supply Chain Management A Study showed that online retailers that use AI for inventory forecasting saw an average 52% improvement in accuracy, leading to a 45% reduction in excess inventory. Using predictive analytics, AI forecasts demand patterns based on seasonality, trends, and external factors (like weather or local events). This helps retailers optimize stock levels, prevent overstocking or stockouts, and improve fulfillment efficiency. Dynamic Pricing Optimization AI algorithms monitor competitor pricing, demand fluctuations, and user behavior to adjust prices in real time. This ensures competitiveness while maximizing profit margins, especially useful during flash sales or holiday seasons. For example, Amazon changes prices every 10 minutes on average, reported a significant increase in gross margins compared to static pricing models. Fraud Detection and Transaction Security Machine learning models detect unusual patterns in transactions, such as multiple failed attempts, mismatched billing addresses, or high-risk geolocations. This helps prevent chargebacks and protects both merchants and customers. This is what happened to JP Morgan, which uses AI-powered fraud shields to reduce scams by 40%. Enhanced Product Search and Discovery Traditional keyword searches are being replaced by AI-driven systems that understand natural language and visual cues. Features like visual search (upload a photo to find products) and semantic search (understanding intent behind queries) dramatically improve user experience. With AI-powered search, it can reduce bounce rates by up to 40% and increase average session duration. Automated Marketing and Campaign Optimization AI also optimizes marketing efforts by predicting which messages resonate best with specific customer segments. From email subject lines to ad targeting, tools like AI copywriters can generate product descriptions and promotional content in seconds. Businesses using AI for marketing report 3x faster campaign deployment and 40% higher ROI (Return on Investment) on ad spend. How AI ",

    "extractedText": "Lance Owide As AI continues to reshape the digital landscape, its impact on B2B ecommerce is profound. From optimizing operations to enhancing customer experience and driving growth, AI’s evolving role presents both challenges and opportunities for B2B manufacturing and distributing decision-makers. AI can help B2B organizations make informed decisions around dynamic pricing, demand forecasting, and buyer behavior predictions. The Current State of B2B Ecommerce B2B ecommerce is experiencing unprecedented growth. According to Grandview Research, in 2023 the global B2B ecommerce market was valued at $18.7 trillion, with projections indicating it will reach $57.6 trillion by 2030. This rapid expansion is driven by the increasing adoption of digital channels across B2B sectors, as businesses recognize the efficiency and scalability that ecommerce offers. As B2B ecommerce continues to grow, the integration of AI is becoming crucial. AI has the potential to act as a force multiplier for in-house teams, automating processes and providing data-driven insights that fuel strategic decision-making. To remain competitive in this evolving landscape, B2B organizations must invest in AI-driven solutions that optimize operations and enhance the buyer experience. Core Areas Where AI Can Make an Impact AI’s impact on B2B ecommerce spans business strategy, buyer experience and operations, with each area benefiting from its automation and predictive capabilities. Below are three ways AI can make a business impact. 1. Fuel Business Strategy AI-driven systems have the potential to revolutionize how B2B organizations approach their business strategy. One of the most valuable applications of AI is its ability to harness data for predictive analytics. By collecting and analyzing product, customer and order data, AI can help B2B organizations make more informed decisions around dynamic pricing, demand forecasting and buyer behavior predictions. For example, AI can forecast demand giving businesses the ability to adjust inventory and pricing, update budgets, reduce risk and even identify new opportunities. Additionally, it can analyze buyer behavior to provide insights into which products are likely to perform best in different markets. The result? B2B manufacturers and distributors can become more proactive and strategic in decision-making to secure competitive advantages and ensure long-term success. 2. Enhance the Buyer Experience In B2B ecommerce, providing a seamless and personalized buyer experience is essential for building long-term relationships. AI can enhance customer service through the use of chatbots and virtual assistants powered by large language models (LLMs). These tools provide 24/7 real-time assistance, answering customer queries and guiding purchases. In addition to enhancing customer service, AI delivers tailored product recommendations based on user preferences and behavior, creating a more personalized experience. This level of customization not only increases the chance of repeat business but also strengthens brand loyalty by making the purchasing process more seamless and efficient than ever before. For instance, if a retail or hospitality business partners with a wholesale distributor like Twin Liquors to stock their shelves with the 200 most popular liquor bottles in the U.S., AI can automatically generate a curated order. This saves time and ensures that the buyer gets the necessary products without the hassle of manual searching. 3. Optimize Operations and Sales AI is transforming operational efficiency in B2B ecommerce, particularly in areas like supply chain management and sales optimization. Predictive analytics powered by AI can improve inventory management, ensuring that businesses maintain optimal stock levels while avoiding overstocking or understocking. AI also plays a critical role in streamlining the quote-to-cash process and can offer an AI-integrated quote workflow that automates pricing configurations and speeds up the quoting process, allowing sales reps to focus on closing deals more efficiently. Best Practices for AI Integration Implementing AI in B2B ecommerce requires a thoughtful approach to integration, data management and scalability. To begin, businesses must ensure that AI solutions seamlessly integrate with their existing systems, such as ERP and CRM platforms. Starting with AI tools that align with the company’s current digital infrastructure is essential to avoid unnecessary complexity. Data management is another critical factor in AI implementation. AI’s effectiveness relies heavily on the quality of the data it processes. Businesses must prioritize regular data audits and cleansing practices to ensure the accuracy and integrity of their data. Clean, reliable data enables AI to generate accurate insights and predictions, which in turn drives better decision-making. Finally, B2B brands should choose AI platforms that offer scalability and customization. As the business grows, AI",

It can when it focuses on improving how customers discover products, receive support, and engage with the brand. But GenAI can’t progress beyond possibilities, plans, and proof of concept without concrete objectives driven by cloud and pipeline-as-code infrastructure. This is the only way to support real business outcomes that enhance customer experience, marketing, and competitiveness and improve margins. Your retail enterprise can move beyond isolated AI experiments or one-off pilot tools to repeatable processes that turn AI into operational capability at scale. GenAI is already helping the largest retailers put customers first while maintaining a competitive edge: For example, Walmart introduced a GenAI-based chatbot in June 2025. This type of approach, when built on a cloud foundation designed for retail, is the key to achieving generative AI success in any retail enterprise. Generative AI can only be the new retail imperative when you know what’s possible. In this article, we’ll explore concrete GenAI use cases for retailers and provide foundational tips for planning and implementation. By the end, you’ll have a clear sense of how to leverage generative AI to maximize innovation and value. How Generative AI Enhances the Retail Customer Experience As a retailer, you’re already focused on scaling personalization and delivering digital experiences that adapt to customers’ needs in real time. Generative AI can help you accelerate and further personalize this process. According to AI-powered mobile marketing leader Attentive’s global survey, 96% of consumers report they are more likely to make a purchase when a brand delivers personalized messages. The two biggest opportunities are producing content and facilitating interactions that reflect customer intent, behavior, and context. CX and marketing have always relied on a creative layer that comes with scalability, customization, and delivery bottlenecks. Generative AI can eliminate these bottlenecks when the retailer is prepared with: Clean and structured product data Clear voice and brand messaging frameworks Cloud infrastructure capable of handling fluctuating needs and markets Governance processes to monitor output quality and compliance GenAI enables you to create and adapt messages, product descriptions, guidance text, and conversation flows dynamically. It can also scale your creative output without diluting your brand’s voice. The challenge is always on the input side. You need to build every experience on consistent data/data strategies, well-defined workflows, and stable infrastructure. Next, let’s look at specific examples of what’s possible and what it takes to get there. Product Descriptions at Scale The most prominent use cases for generative AI in retail focus on how customers discover, evaluate, and select products. You’re already spending a lot of effort creating product detail pages, style guides, category descriptions, and promotional stories. The sheer volume of required content makes it difficult to maintain brand equity, but GenAI allows you to: Generate and scale clear and interesting product descriptions with individual attributes, materials, and features Reduce time to market Drive consistent quality and uniform messaging across global catalog product launches, ensuring alignment with cultural, language, and retail platform norms Give creative teams the control to focus on storytelling, campaigns, brand experience, and performance analysis rather than production workflows Cut creative costs while keeping catalogs fresh and aligned with inventory Improve publishing speed and reduce delays between inventory arrival and online availability It all starts with the right foundation of cloud, data, and infrastructure to make the most of AI. You can then create product description pathways that improve CX and minimize returns. Personalized Marketing Content The same logic applies to personalized marketing content. Generative AI can adapt messaging to reflect actual customer behavior rather than broad demographic segments, allowing your marketing messages to change based on customer intent rather than following pre-scheduled campaigns. Your marketing content can adapt based on what customers view, compare, and add or remove from carts, all of which affect the marketing content they see. (Even in-store purchases can shape this customization.) GenAI uses interaction patterns to improve messaging by: Analyzing browsing, purchase, and loyalty data to drive relevance for segment-based email, ad, and push copy Shifting messages based on what customers interact with to deliver creative messages that spur sales Understanding when and how to deliver the right message so customers feel supported, not annoyed The aim is to make personalization meaningful so that messages reflect genuine customer",

    "extractedText": "How Generative AI Is Transforming Customer Experience for Retail & QSR BrandsRyan Grant&No items found.As of late 2025, the retail and Quick-Service Restaurant (QSR) industries are at a pivotal moment. They aren’t just dabbling in AI anymore; They’re rewiring how discovery, ordering, service, and loyalty work.With customer expectations rising and competition fierce, brands are searching for new ways to connect with their audience. Generative AI (GenAI) lets brands personalize at scale, compress creative cycles, and turn fragmented data into real-time, one-to-one experiences.This isn't just a technological upgrade; it's a strategic shift toward hyper-personalization and efficiency that is fundamentally reshaping the customer experience. But outcomes depend directly on the quality of the models, data, and guardrails you deploy. Move fast, but move right.What is Generative AI?Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that creates new content (like text, images, audio, code, or video) based on patterns it learned from large amounts of existing data.Instead of just classifying or retrieving information, it predicts what to generate next (e.g., the next word, pixel, or note) to produce original outputs that match a user’s prompt and constraints.Why Retail and QSR Brands are Leaning into AI By late 2024, 71% of organizations reported actively using generative AI (GenAI) in at least one area of their business. Smart brands don't just adopt Generative AI for the sake of innovation, they deploy it because real user insights reveal where customers need better guidance, faster answers, or more relevant recommendations.Backend efficiency is a benefit, but the primary goal is creating contextual interactions that feel natural and genuinely valuable. Get the customer experience right, and profitability follows. Here's a deeper look at the strategy behind this move:Unprecedented PersonalizationGenerative AI analyzes customer data, from past purchases and browsing history to location and real-time behavior, to create a comprehensive understanding of each individual. This allows brands to move beyond generic recommendations and deliver truly tailored experiences.Imagine a QSR app that suggests a custom meal based on your last order, or a clothing retailer that uses a chatbot to help you build a complete outfit for a specific event. This level of personalized engagement fosters a sense of being understood and valued. Customers feel recognized, not targeted.Enhanced Customer ServiceGenerative AI-powered chatbots excel at managing high-volume, routine inquiries with human-like conversation. By handling simple, repetitive tasks (like order tracking or answering FAQs) they provide instant, 24/7 support. This frees your human agents to focus where they deliver the most impact: handling complex questions, solving nuanced problems, and building genuine customer relationships. With more time, your team can provide the strategic, high-empathy value that machines can't replicate, turning standard support calls into loyalty-building connections.Challenging Our Work, Inspiring New IdeasWe believe technology should serve creativity, not dictate it. At Brandience, we use Generative AI as a tool to push our thinking and challenge our work. Instead of asking it to create final content, we use it to brainstorm possibilities, asking \"What if?\" in countless ways to uncover the most compelling campaign ideas.These tools help us visualize concepts faster than ever before, allowing our teams to see and react to ideas in near real-time. This iterative process of generating, challenging, and refining ensures our work is more robust and innovative. The final execution is always driven by our team's strategic expertise, but it's sharpened by the limitless exploratory power of AI.Responsible AI Use: How to Balance Innovation with Human ImpactAs Generative AI’s capabilities continue to evolve and automation streamlines repetitive tasks, it will also reshapes roles that were once central to human interaction. For brands committed to human-centered innovation, the challenge isn’t just adopting AI, it’s doing so ethically and remembering to keep the human at the center of everything. That means being transparent about how AI is used, retraining teams to work alongside it, and keeping a clear focus on its impact on both employees and customers. Responsible AI is a tech decision and a CX strategy.Building Agentic Assistants That Deliver Real ValueNow for the practical part. How do you actually deploy Generative AI in ways that move the needle? The answer is agentic assistants: AI-powered tools that don't just respond to prompts but actively help customers and employees accomplish specific goals. These aren't generic chatbots; they're purpose-built agents designed to guide decisions, solve problems, and take action within defined guardrails.Here's a few ways to use them.1) Decision Guidance That Cuts Through Choice OverloadThink of this as your brand",

By Merritt Robinson, Mikey Vu, Arpan Sheth, Andre Tanaka, and Colleen Lin min read } Brief Generative AI’s Potential to Improve Customer Experience Progress: en At a Glance Retail customers are optimistic about generative AI: Bain’s research finds that about half of those surveyed see great potential in these new tools. Customers value passive generative AI features such as summarizing reviews integrated into their journeys—sometimes even more than they value standalone generative AI features. Online shoppers understand the potential for personalization with generative AI, and they seem more willing to share personal data than they might in other contexts. In retail, generative AI can help deliver great customer service more efficiently, especially in parts of the journey that have proven more difficult to reach. In retail, as in other industries, generative AI promises to change the customer experience. Retailers are deploying AI-enhanced tools such as summaries of product reviews, chatbots, and shopping assistants in an effort to facilitate purchase decisions, reduce friction, and increase conversion. While businesses are experimenting and assessing the impact of generative AI tools in the shopping journey, customers are still getting used to the new interactions and features impacting their online shopping experience—and as with everything about generative AI, we are finding their perceptions to be both the same as and different from what we’ve known in the past. To help retailers think about deploying generative AI in a customer-centric way, Bain surveyed more than 700 online shoppers in the United States about their knowledge of and experience with generative AI. Awareness of these tools is low among customers: 71% said they were not aware of having used generative AI in their online shopping even though most had shopped recently with retailers where they were likely to have encountered them. But despite low awareness, customers are optimistic about the impact of generative AI, with roughly half seeing significant or transformative potential. In addition to the survey, we interviewed online shoppers and compared traditional and new shopping experiences with different types of generative AI, taking into consideration customers’ expectations about personalization. We then mapped their perceptions over the entire purchasing journey—from awareness to purchase and beyond. This research has allowed us to define five design principles that cumulatively suggest that the most effective early use cases for generative AI may lie in designing experiences that enhance and expand the current retail journey rather than serving as a standalone platform for engagement. Five design principles for deploying GenAI in the customer journey 1. Enhance shopping habits with generative AI without disrupting customer preferences Customers said their top reasons for not using generative AI tools while shopping online are because they’re satisfied with current methods and don’t see the need for new tools, which is understandable: Online shopping has evolved its tools and experiences over decades, and solutions have been fine-tuned to customer needs (see Figure 1). Figure 1 Retail customers say they don’t need, don’t trust, or haven’t encountered generative AI tools Note: Includes respondents who have heard of generative AI tools for online shopping but have not used them (n=276) Source: Bain Generative AI Usage Survey, July 2024 (n=714) For example, in product walkthroughs of conversational shopping assistants, customers were often unclear about the difference between their current search methods and the newer generative AI tools for searching and exploring products. One customer was surprised that the conversational shopping assistant didn’t prioritize products she had bought in the past, a feature that the traditional search provided: “I might just go back up to the search bar … because I bought this product before.… And I literally just have to type it into the search bar, and it knows what I want.” While innovating requires a test-and-learn approach, our research suggests that retailers should frame these new generative AI experiments as such and strive for a complementary value proposition. Otherwise, there’s a risk that customers could be confused by having different tools available to achieve similar goals; there’s also a risk that they will require more significant re-familiarization in the future after early experiments make generative AI seem less attractive by comparison. Strategic implications Use generative AI to complement current flows. Standalone generative AI tools can serve some existing use cases, but they are more interesting to customers when they serve needs in new ways or bring something t",

As generative AI continues to evolve, one thing is clear: the future of retail is not just digital — it’s intelligent, sustainable and customer-centric.Photo: Adobe StockApril 25, 2025 by Melanie Nuce-Hilton — Senior Vice President of Customer Success, GS1 USGenerative AI is transforming the retail industry in a myriad of ways, including enabling personalized shopping, customized style recommendations, virtual try-ons and so much more. It's reshaping how retailers engage with their customers — both online and in-store — while driving operational efficiencies and supporting sustainability.From improving decision-making to enhancing supply chains, generative AI is not just a technological advancement; it's a game-changer for the future of retail.The age of personalization in retailToday's shoppers expect brands to understand their preferences and provide tailored experiences. Generative AI is helping retailers meet this demand by analyzing purchasing behavior, browsing history, and even social media interactions to create dynamic, accurate customer profiles. Such data supports retail success, with a McKinsey report highlighting that effective personalization can increase sales by 10%–15% and improve customer satisfaction by 20%.For example, AI-powered recommendation engines guide customers with personalized product suggestions that improve decision-making at every touch point. Consider a shopper who buys a summer dress — AI might suggest coordinating accessories or a cardigan for cooler evenings. These personalized interactions make shopping intuitive and enjoyable, boosting engagement and conversion rates.Unlike static recommendation systems, Gen AI adapts in real-time to changes in customer behavior so every interaction feels relevant and timely. Retailers who adopt these systems see significant improvements in customer loyalty and overall sales, underscoring the value of a personalized approach.Virtual try-ons: Bridging digital and physical retailOne of the most impactful applications of generative AI is the virtual try-on experience, which merges the convenience of digital tools with the tactile nature of in-store shopping. In e-commerce, virtual try-ons empower shoppers to accurately visualize products — such as lipstick shades or eyewear frames — increasing their confidence in purchasing decisions.In physical retail, smart mirrors and AI-powered kiosks bring this technology into stores. Smart mirrors allow customers to \"try on\" outfits without changing clothes, while kiosks offer personalized recommendations and styling advice based on the items shoppers select. These innovations create seamless, interactive shopping experiences that blend digital and physical touch points.Beyond convenience, virtual try-ons address a critical industry challenge: returns. A 2022 report by the National Retail Federation revealed that product fit and style mismatches are among the top causes of e-commerce returns, costing retailers billions annually. Virtual try-ons help reduce the risk for returns, enhancing customer satisfaction while lowering operational costs. It's a win-win for consumers and retailers alike.Enhancing supply chain efficiency and sustainabilityGenerative AI is not only transforming the shopping experience but also the supply chains that support it. By leveraging advanced data analysis, AI helps retailers improve inventory accuracy, reduce stockouts, and predict demand with greater precision. For shoppers, this means fewer \"out-of-stock\" notifications and more consistent access to products.Streamlining logistics, AI also optimizes delivery routes and schedules, resulting in faster shipping and lower costs. By analyzing purchasing trends and regional preferences, generative AI keeps supply chains agile and responsive, ensuring retailers meet consumer demands efficiently.On the sustainability front, generative AI plays a vital role in reducing overproduction and waste. By aligning production volumes with actual demand, businesses minimize their environmental impact while catering to eco-conscious consumers. Retailers who integrate smarter forecasting and inventory management enhance their operational efficiency while fostering stronger relationships with sustainability-minded shoppers.Collaborative ecosystems for AI successTo fully realize the benefits of generative AI, retailers must collaborate across the supply chain. Standardized data, master data quality, and interoperability are essential for seamless AI integration, ensuring that all stakeholders — from suppliers to logistics providers — work from a single source of truth.High-quality master data forms the backbone of AI-driven operations, enabling consistent and accurate insights.

In the realm of fashion, traditional brick and mortar stores benefit significantly from knowledgeable salespersons who engage in detailed discussions about style, occasion suitability, and guide customers to understand and refine their preferences, a nuance that online platforms struggle to replicate. To address this challenge, we harness the capabilities of LLMs to revolutionize eBay’s fashion recommendation system. Specifically, our approach utilizes LLMs to systematically categorize items into coherent pivot groups and subsequently generate deep learning embedding centers for these groups, offering a unique strategy for the organized presentation of candidate items within these well-defined themes. This approach not only facilitates a more streamlined product discovery process but also incorporates a degree of customization and context sensitivity that surpasses the capabilities of conventional recommendation algorithms.BackgroundIn the fast-paced world of online fashion shopping, the challenge of delivering customized and relevant product recommendations is particularly pronounced. Currently, when users browse through women’s fashion or fashion items in general, shown in Figure 1 below, they often seek specific styles of clothing suitable for particular occasions.Press enter or click to view image in full sizeFigure 1: Current “Similar sponsored items” on View Item PageHowever, this crucial information is not always clearly presented in the item titles or descriptions provided by sellers. In contrast to the traditional in-store shopping experience, where knowledgeable salespersons engage customers in detailed discussions about the style, occasion suitability, and guide them through similar pieces to better understand their preferences, we’re aiming to replicate and improve upon this personalized assistance for eBay fashion items.In physical stores, salespeople play a pivotal role in guiding customers through the intricacies of fashion. They discuss the style aesthetics of each piece, its suitability for various occasions, and show customers other similar pieces to help them better understand and refine their preferences. Our goal is to harness the power of LLM to recreate this personalized shopping experience online. Through this approach, we aim to not only assist buyers in finding the perfect fashion items but also recreate the sense of personalized guidance and expertise that one would typically experience in a physical store. Ultimately, we strive to make the fashion discovery process on eBay more engaging, informative, and satisfying for our users.ApproachWe crafted pivot groups, shown in Figure 2 as text pills, to be context and product-aware, enhancing eBay’s recommendation list by offering dynamic buttons that act as filters and allowing users to refine their search based on themes aligned with their interests. These pivot groups, generated by LLMs, provide a guide for users to a curated selection of products that resonate with their chosen context. By facilitating a more comprehensive exploration of eBay inventory, pivot groups increase the likelihood of conversion, making it easier for shoppers to find and purchase items that perfectly match their fashion sensibilities, thus making online browsing a more rewarding endeavor.Press enter or click to view image in full sizePress enter or click to view image in full sizeFigure 2: Pivot Group Examples for Women’s Dresses RecommendationsWe selected the women’s dress category for our study due to its dynamic nature and significant variation in styles and trends, making it an ideal domain to demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of our novel recommendation system. We generate the pivot groups in the preparatory offline phase; our methodology is to select the most popular items and their “Similar sponsored items” in the women’s fashion sector, ensuring our selections mirror the latest stylistic currents and consumer inclinations. By harnessing the analytical and reasoning prowess of LLMs, we meticulously categorized these fashion items into distinctive theme groups based on their inherent characteristics. This strategic categorization allowed for a nuanced understanding of how various items align within the thematic spectrum of women’s fashion. Following the delineation o",

    "extractedText": "Online shopping has become a cornerstone of daily life now. It offers unparalleled convenience, allowing us to browse and purchase a myriad of products without leaving our homes. Yet, this convenience often comes with its own set of frustrations. As consumers, we frequently find ourselves grappling with fragmented experiences. These hurdles stem from e-commerce systems that have not kept pace with modern expectations. This is where Large Language Models (LLMs) step in, promising to redefine how we discover products online. By seamlessly blending the disjointed tools of search bars, filters, and chatbots into a coherent, conversational journey, LLMs aren’t just enhancing e-commerce; they’re revolutionizing it. So, how do they achieve this? Understanding the Current Landscape and Its Challenges Before exploring LLMs’ transformative potential, it’s crucial to understand the limitations of our current systems and why they’re due for an upgrade. Search Bars: From Innovators to Stagnators Initially, search bars were a revelation. They allowed us to type in what we wanted and receive a list of potential matches, a significant leap from manually sifting through catalogs. However, with time, the cracks in this system became evident. The primary issue lies in their reliance on keyword matching. If you type “winter boots for snow,” you’d expect relevant results. But often, if those exact keywords aren’t part of a product’s description, the result page might be underwhelming. Search bars don’t consider the context or the true intent behind queries. Imagine a shopper typing “headphones comfortable for long flights” and receiving results unrelated to comfort, purely due to misaligned keywords. Further, these search engines treat every user interaction as an isolated incident. There’s little to no personalization. Whether you’re a first-time visitor or a returning customer with a specific buying pattern, the system generates the same results. Reports indicate that 72% of consumers abandon shopping sites if the search experience isn’t up to par. Gojek saw a 20%+ increase in search-to-order conversion using ML-powered personalized search, while Airbnb and Etsy reported higher engagement and purchase rates from machine learning ranking models (Source: AWS). It’s not just about losing a sale; it’s about creating a barrier between the consumer and their desired product. This lack of context-awareness in search is one reason eCommerce leaders turn to custom AI-powered search solutions that personalize discovery across channels. Filters: Tools of Precision or Overwhelming Labyrinths? Filters should simplify decision-making by allowing users to refine product searches by various attributes. They’ve become a staple feature for narrowing down choices in vast product inventories. However, these filters often miss the mark. Why? They’re usually rigid and static, pre-determined by the retail platform without adapting to nuanced shopper needs. A search for “eco-friendly water bottles with a straw” might yield an overwhelming list without the option to refine by sustainability features or lid type. When shoppers can’t find the filters they need, it leads to “filter fatigue,” where users toggle through endless options without getting closer to what they want. Compounding this frustration is the all-too-familiar “zero results” page, which looms when filters are too restrictive. These dead ends can cause users to backtrack, adjust, and try again, often losing patience in the process. It echoes the “No Results Found” frustration from search bars. Finally, collaborative filtering often underlies recommendation systems and brings more challenges. While popular items get pushed to more users, lesser-known or new products languish in obscurity due to the “cold start” issue: lack of data means poor recommendations, reducing inventory diversity over time. Chatbots: Automated Helpers with a Limiting Framework When chatbots entered the e-commerce space, they were heralded as the next step in customer service evolution. Operating around the clock, they promised instant responses for general inquiries. However, their script-based nature quickly became apparent. Imagine asking a chatbot about eco-friendly dishwasher detergents, only for it to give canned responses about detergent brands without sustainability credentials. When faced with specific, unscripted questions, these chatbots can become more of a hindrance than a help. They also struggle with scalability. As product catalogs expand, updating chatbot scripts becomes cumbersome, causing them to function as bottlenecks in rapidly changing marketplaces. Redefining the Landscape with LLMs Given these challenges, how do LLMs step up to address them? Revolutionizing Search: Understanding Intent, Not Just Keywords LLMs allow e-commerce platforms to transition from keyword-dependent searches to understanding the full context of queries.

    "extractedText": "AI, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), is transforming not just how we live and work, but how we shop. Instead of searching ‘quick family dinners’, we now ask highly specific, conversational queries, such as: ‘Find me a recipe that my 5-year-old won’t refuse and takes under 20 minutes to cook’. This shift away from keyword-based search to dialogue-led discovery marks a turning point for consumers, retailers, and advertisers alike. Context, nuance, and intent now matter more than typing the ‘right’ keyword. ChatGPT has become one of the world’s five most visited websites, overtaking X (formerly Twitter). Meanwhile Google’s search share has dipped below 90% for the first time in decades. Its recent ‘Just Ask Google’ campaign signals an effort to reposition itself for a natural-language future where conversations, not keywords, are the entry point. For retailers and advertisers, these intent-rich queries are a goldmine. The convergence of retailer data, publisher content, and consumer behaviour could create the richest live dataset in commerce fuelling predictive, adaptive, and hyper-personalised shopping experiences. For consumers: context-rich, predictive journeys The benefit for consumers is clear. AI-powered experiences are becoming contextually aware and deeply personalised. Imagine an LLM that knows your favourite clothing brand and automatically suggests alternatives when your size is out of stock, or one that recommends a new vacuum cleaner because it has learned from your address change that you’ve recently moved house. As LLMs merge with voice assistants and wearable devices, shoppable moments will increasingly emerge as organic byproducts of conversation, much like interacting with a trusted in-store assistant. For retailers: data as the new leverage For retailers, data is the new competitive currency. Giants such as Walmart, Kroger, Carrefour, and Tesco already control rich ecosystems of loyalty programs, closed-loop measurement, and logged-in shoppers. These datasets allow them to selectively power LLM interactions while keeping their most valuable data monetised inside their own Retail Media Networks (RMNs). However, the balance of power is delicate. Even if a retailer withheld product data from an LLM, its unlikely consumers would abandon that store altogether, giving retailers leverage to negotiate terms, much like Amazon’s strategy of limiting external access to its product catalogue. Smaller retailers have fewer options. Without extensive datasets or brand dominance, they may be forced to share their data to remain visible in AI-powered shopping journeys, sometimes even partnering with dominant platforms simply to stay in the consideration set. For advertisers: winning over humans and machines For advertisers, LLM-driven commerce is both a disruption and an opportunity. As the traditional marketing funnel (awareness, consideration, purchase) collapses and is replaced by AI-mediated decision pathways, brands must now compete not only for human attention but also for algorithmic visibility inside the ‘reasoning’ process of LLMs. This raises urgent new questions: What is a brand’s share of voice within LLM outputs? How do your campaigns influence AI-generated recommendations? How can you measure salience and conversion in a world where bots are gatekeepers? Those who begin defining these new metrics today will shape the playbook for the next era of advertising. For publishers: content as fuel Publishers face continued pressure as AI answers reduce direct traffic and affiliate revenues. But content remains the foundation of LLMs. The opportunity lies in creating AI-native content, structured, metadata-rich, and licensed for model training. The New York Times’ decision to license its archive to AI companies illustrates how publishers can secure both relevance and revenue in the age of conversational search. Others will need to adapt quickly or risk losing visibility entirely. RMNs: anchors in the AI era Retail Media Networks (RMNs) are uniquely positioned to thrive in this landscape. They connect first-party retailer data, media activation, and closed-loop measurement, meaning they can seamlessly integrate with LLM-powered discovery. As discovery shifts from keyword search to dialogue, retailers that embed their RMNs into LLM systems will gain deeper shopper engagement and stronger influence over the moments that drive purchase decisions. As AI fast becomes retail’s operating system, and search is becoming conversation, bots are emerging as decision gatekeepers. And the fusion of data, content, and intent will determine which brands, retailers, and publishers thrive, or vanish, in this next era of AI-driven commerce.

    "extractedText": "Transforming Fashion with AI: A Comparative Study of Large Language Models in Apparel Design Nusrat Jahan Lamia1, Sadia Afrin Mim 2 1njlamia17@gmail.com 2safrinmi@gmu.edu 1Bangladesh University of Textiles 2 George Mason University Abstract Fashion has evolved from handcrafted designs to automated production over the years, where AI has added another dimension to it. Nowadays, practically every industry uses artificial models to automate their operations. To explore their role, we examined three prominent LLMs (OpenAI, GeminiAI, Deepseek) in multiple stages of textile manufacturing (e.g., sustainable choice, cost effectiveness, production planning, etc.). We assessed the models’ ability to replicate garment design using certain parameters (fabric construction, shade, weave, silhouette, etc.). We compared the models in terms of different body types and functional purposes (e.g., fashionwear, sportswear) so that designers could evaluate effectiveness before developing actual patterns, make necessary modifications, and conduct fashion forecasting beforehand. To facilitate deeper analysis, we created a custom dataset specifically for fabric image generation and classification. Our analysis revealed that, in terms of fabric construction, the OpenAI DALL-E model integrated with ChatGPT outperformed other models, achieving a lower LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity) score of approximately 0.20.2. In fabric classification from images, we found OpenAI offered the best results by breaking down certain factors (e.g., breathability, moisture-wicking, and tactile comfort), achieving approximately 80%80\\% accuracy for base construction and 55%55\\% for detailed construction. However, our results indicate that Deepseek faced significant challenges in generating and recognizing fabric images. Overall, all the models struggled to recognize complex fabric constructions and intricate designs from images, and relying too much on AI might hinder human creativity. We also observed that all three models performed effectively in providing recommendations and insights for fabric design in textual form. Index Terms: Apparel, Design, Fashion, Artificial Intelligence, LLM I Introduction 111This paper is accepted on 3rd International Conference on Textile Science and Engineering For a very long time, fashion has been an embodiment of craftsmanship, innovation and civilization. In the past, it required a lot of effort to design and manufacture garments which largely depended on skilled artisans who meticulously crafted each item by hand. With the advancement of technology, automation has entered the process and production is being streamlined by digital pattern making, advanced industrial sewing machines, and computer aided design (CAD) integration with computer aided manufacturing (CAM). However, the most recent change in the garment industry which is the adoption of Artificial intelligence (AI), is influencing the production process to a large extent from design selection to trend forecasting. Adopting AI in the garment industry could be greatly beneficial to streamline manufacturing, improve production efficiency and forecast fashion with greater accuracy. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI are automating critical stages, from material selection and style generation to production and trend analysis. This integration improves efficiency and sustainability, enabling personalized fashion solutions. Tools like DALL-E, Gemini, and Deepseek are streamlining processes, assisting with sample making, cost analysis, and virtual try-on. Designers are now collaborating with AI to predict trends and optimize fabric choices. While AI enhances productivity and innovation, questions persist about its capacity to fully replicate or surpass human creativity. The balance between AI’s analytical power and human artistic intuition remains a key consideration in the future of fashion. Several research studies have explored AI’s role in fashion. Monteresso et al examined how AI models contribute to the fashion design process highlighting how AI can optimize creation processes, improve operational efficiency and shorten development times without compromising the quality and creativity[1]. Preliminary analysis revealed that ChatGPT and The New Black AI are the most suited tools. Qianqian Chen et al introduced Fashion-GPT, a model suitable for fashion retrieval systems and compared its performance with ChatGPT, Gemini and Deepseek[2]. Their findings showed that Fashion-GPT outperformed general models like ChatGPT in fashion-specific tasks particularly multi-view, multi-modal matching in fashion queries. Wenda Shi provided an overview which discussed incorporation of GenAI into fashion-related tasks and applications, multi-modal fashion understanding and fashion synthesis of image[3] with 53 publicly available datasets suitable for training and benchmarking fashion-centric models.

Current data shows that nearly 40% of organizations plan to train and customize LLMs to address their specific business requirements. Retail CTOs are investigating how these AI technologies can enhance operations and fuel business growth. LLMs process information like the human brain but can analyze massive datasets at unprecedented speeds. Major players in the industry, including Instacart and Amazon, have already implemented these technologies to strengthen product recommendations and enhance search relevance. What specific value do LLMs bring to your e-commerce business? They elevate basic chatbots into sophisticated conversational assistants capable of understanding context and delivering personalized recommendations. These models also streamline customer support by correctly interpreting customer queries, minimizing human intervention, and delivering faster responses. Beyond customer service, they enable effective upselling and cross-selling by examining customer data to predict needs and potentially increase average cart value. For your bottom line, perhaps the most significant benefit comes from the hyper-personalized shopping experiences LLMs create. Customers can now use conversational search to receive highly accurate product suggestions. This personalization capability, combined with LLMs' ability to generate quality product descriptions and SEO content, can substantially increase your online visibility and attract more qualified traffic to your e-commerce platform. Key Takeaways LLMs are transforming e-commerce by driving personalization, improving search relevance, and enhancing customer interactions. Early adopters like Amazon and Instacart show that LLMs deliver measurable results in sales, efficiency, and customer loyalty. Strategic integration of multiple LLM use cases creates a multiplier effect, boosting both customer experience and backend operations. Starting with high-impact, low-complexity applications such as customer support automation can provide fast ROI and momentum for broader adoption. LLM-Powered Product Search Optimization Traditional e-commerce search engines struggle when shoppers use natural language queries. LLM-powered product search offers retail CTOs a powerful solution for connecting customers with relevant products and boosting conversions. Use Case Overview Search functionality forms the core of the e-commerce customer experience. Conventional search depends on keyword matching, but LLM-powered search interprets natural language to deliver results based on context, intent, and sentiment. This distinction proves particularly valuable when customers use everyday language or vague queries instead of specific product terminology. A Gartner study shows that 80% of customers prefer to buy from retailers providing personalized search experiences. Additionally, platforms with AI-powered search capabilities achieve up to 25% higher customer satisfaction and engagement rates. How It Works? Product search gains two major advantages from LLM integration: LLM-Based Precision - These models handle both general and specific queries effectively, from simple searches like \"men's running shoes\" to detailed requests such as \"women's hiking boots size 8\". The system comprehends search intent rather than merely matching keywords. LLM-Based Recall - By utilizing synonyms, spell corrections, and relaxation rules, LLMs grasp semantic meanings in customer queries. This means searches like \"running shoes good for knees\" still return appropriate results despite lacking exact product attribute matches. Setting up this capability typically requires: Downloading a pre-trained open-source LLM Converting product text into embeddings Configuring the model to search against these embeddings Deploying as a microservice integrated with applications Benefits for Retailers Retail leadership sees several concrete advantages from LLM-powered search: Better handling of \"torso\" and long-tail searches, helping users find products they genuinely want Improved interpretation of ambiguous searches (e.g., \"I need something warm for winter workouts\") Smarter management of typos, synonyms, and collo",

As the Founder and CEO of The Clear Cut, this 4th generation diamond expert and Forbes 30 Under 30 honoree is transforming how consumers discover, purchase, and experience diamond jewelry.From Blog to Breakthrough: The Clear Cut's Origin StoryWhat started as an educational blog in 2016 has evolved into a multi-million dollar direct-to-consumer diamond jewelry company. Landau's journey began when friends and family started seeking her advice about purchasing engagement rings, leading her to create content that would demystify the traditionally opaque diamond buying process.The timing couldn't have been more perfect. The Clear Cut just closed their strongest Q1 since 2022, with engagement ring sales up 50% year-over-year in February–March 2025 and average order value increasing by 42%. This impressive growth underscores the market's hunger for transparency and personalization in luxury retail.Meet Eunice: The AI Engine Redefining Retail IntelligenceThe crown jewel of The Clear Cut's innovation is Eunice - a proprietary AI platform named after Eunice Miles, the first female gemologist. This isn't just another retail AI tool; it's a comprehensive intelligence system that's revolutionizing how luxury goods are priced, sourced, and sold.Eunice's Advanced Capabilities:Dynamic Pricing Intelligence: Analyzes vendor pricing patterns across the entire diamond market, breaking down the traditional \"this is the price\" model that has dominated the industry for decadesGranular Regional Analytics: Tracks customer trends across specific U.S. regions and neighborhoods—for example, identifying that SoHo and TriBeCa customers prefer 2.2 carat cushion-cut diamonds (58% preference rate) at an average price of $38,600Predictive Trend Analysis: Discovered the consumer shift toward elongated cushion-cut diamonds with specific length-to-width ratios between 1.3 and 1.5External Data Integration: Pulls insights from multiple online marketplaces to validate internal analysis and identify market inefficienciesInventory Gap Detection: Helps manufacturers understand what should be cut from rough diamonds based on real demand data rather than guessworkThe Business Impact:Eunice soft-launched in Q1 2025 and officially debuted in May, contributing directly to The Clear Cut's strongest quarter since 2022. The results speak to the power of AI-driven retail intelligence:50% year-over-year increase in engagement ring sales (February-March 2025)42% increase in average order valueAverage engagement ring value now exceeds $30,000As Kyle Simon, Co-founder and COO, explains: \"Now, we're able to actually analyze what is trending—a variety of factors like what sold many years ago, what's not selling, what are vendors doing across the market.\" This level of market intelligence transforms diamond retail from an intuition-based business to a data-driven science.Industry Recognition and Thought LeadershipLandau's expertise and innovative approach haven't gone unnoticed by industry leaders. She was recently featured at the WFDB Presidents Meeting 2025 in New York, where she shared insights on the future of the diamond industry with global leaders and stakeholders.Her recognition extends beyond industry circles: Landau has been recognized on the Forbes 30 Under 30 and Entrepreneur's 2021 100 Women of Impact list, with The Clear Cut being featured in Forbes, Vogue, Business Insider, TechCrunch, The New York Times and others.The Partnership That Built an EmpireThe Clear Cut's success story is also a love story. Landau met her co-founder and husband, Kyle Simon, while both were studying at the Gemological Institute of America (GIA). Simon, also a Forbes 30 Under 30 honoree and GIA Diamonds Graduate, previously co-founded a fair-trade diamond mining company in Sierra Leone before joining forces with Landau.Their complementary skill sets have been crucial to the company's growth. As Landau notes in interviews, while she focuses on product, customer experience, design, and social media, Simon handles the business operations, finance, and strategic planning - a division that has allowed them to scale efficiently while maintaining their white-glove service approach.Looking Ahead: Shoptalk Fall 2025 and BeyondThe retail world will have the opportunity to learn from Landau's expertise when she takes the stage at Shoptalk Fall 2025 in Chicago (September 17-19). She'll be participating in the highly anticipated retail AI panel: \"Retail Intelligence: What AI Can – and Can't – Do Today\" - a topic she's uniquely positioned to address given her real-world experience implementing AI at scale in luxury retail.This speaking engagement comes at a pivotal moment for re",

You’ve probably heard it before... \"AI helps with personalization,\" \"AI improves inventory management,\" \"AI this, AI that.\" But let’s be real. If we strip away the buzzwords, is AI really revolutionizing jewelry retail the way it has for other industries? Or are we still scratching the surface while thinking we’ve reached the peak? Most retailers are using AI at a basic level: chatbots, simple recommendation engines, automated pricing. That’s great, but it’s like using a Formula 1 car just to drive to the grocery store. AI has the power to completely transform how jewelry is designed, marketed, sold, and experienced. If you’re not thinking beyond the basics, you’re already behind. Let’s talk about the real game-changers: the innovations that could truly disrupt the jewelry industry. AI-Designed Jewelry That Customers Can Co-Create Jewelry has always been about craftsmanship, artistry, and human touch. But what if AI could enhance that rather than replace it? Imagine a customer walking into your store, describing a ring they have in mind, and an AI-powered tool generating a precise 3D model in real-time. Not just pulling up generic templates, but creating a unique piece based on their words, preferences, and even emotional cues detected through AI. Luxury brands are already experimenting with generative AI in design. Some companies allow customers to tweak existing designs, but the real future lies in customers co-creating with AI. This isn’t about replacing designers; it’s about giving them superpowers, enabling them to experiment with shapes, patterns, and materials in ways never imagined. Think of it as custom design at scale; something that was once exclusive to high-end jewelers is now possible for every retailer. That’s how AI changes the game. Predictive AI That Knows What Your Customers Want Before They Do Every retailer dreams of the perfect inventory: never overstocked, never understocked, and always aligned with what customers want. But most inventory decisions are still based on past sales data. That’s like driving while only looking in the rearview mirror. AI can predict trends before they peak. How? By analyzing everything from customer browsing patterns to social media trends, regional preferences, and even economic factors. AI can tell you: Which designs will be hot six months from now. What styles your specific customer base is gravitating toward. How a global fashion trend will trickle down to your local market. It’s not just about stocking the right products: it’s about being one step ahead of consumer demand. Imagine knowing that emeralds will see a surge in popularity next season before your competitors do. Now that is retail intelligence. AI That Reads Emotions and Sells Jewelry Differently Jewelry is emotional. Every purchase, whether an engagement ring, a gift, or even a self-indulgent buy, is tied to a feeling. So why are we still selling it like any other product? AI-driven sentiment analysis can detect why a customer is buying a piece. Is it excitement? Nostalgia? Love? Guilt? Depending on the emotion, your AI-powered sales assistant (whether in-store or online) can adjust the sales approach. A nervous engagement ring buyer? AI can suggest comforting, confidence-boosting messaging. A self-purchase by a career-driven woman? AI can frame the purchase as a reward for success. A hesitant high-value buyer? AI can subtly nudge with social proof—\"This limited edition piece was just bought by someone in New York.\" This isn’t science fiction. AI is already being used in other industries to read microexpressions and tone of voice. Jewelry retail needs to catch up. AI-Powered \"Try Before You Buy\" That’s Actually Convincing Virtual try-ons have been around, but let’s be honest: most of them are clunky. The lighting is off, the scale isn’t perfect, and they don’t truly replicate the experience of holding a piece in your hand. What if AI could simulate how a piece of jewelry feels on you? Advanced AI combined with AR and haptic technology can recreate the weight, sparkle, and even the way light interacts with gemstones. Imagine a virtual experience where a customer sees how a diamond reacts to different lighting—daylight, candlelight, office light—before they buy.

AI is transforming every aspect of the industry, from jewelry design and production to how customers interact with it in the market, helping jewelry stores grow at a rapid pace. That’s why it’s important to understand current AI jewelry applications and the prevailing trends shaping the future of this luxury business.Brief Overview of the Jewelry IndustryJewelry comes in many forms and can vary widely in both the type (rings, bracelets, earrings, necklaces, etc.) and the materials used in its construction (precious metals, gemstones, wood, etc.). The jewelry industry has been valued at $70 billion U.S. dollars with the average customer spending over $130 U.S. dollars on jewelry annually.Introduction to AI and Its Growing InfluenceTraditionally, trades like jewelry making have been labor-intensive processes. The creativity in the design—as well as the quality of the finished product—were entirely dependent on the craftsman’s artistic expertise. However, in recent years, technological advancements such as AI have enabled machines to perform tasks that previously could only be completed by well-trained humans.With advanced processing and pattern recognition capabilities, AI can analyze large datasets in seconds and recognize trends or commonalities, then make predictions based on what patterns it sees. Additionally, AI can continually learn from its experiences, becoming more accurate over time thanks to machine learning algorithms. These skills can be widely applied in a variety of industries, which is why AI has grown so rapidly over the last few years.In the jewelry industry specifically, AI has greatly affected three key parts of the jewelry lifecycle: design, production, and sales.AI in Jewelry DesignBefore AI, jewelry designs were limited by the experience of the designer and the imagination of the customer. Now, thanks to AI jewelry software, the jewelry design process requires much less physical manipulation and less visualization on behalf of the customer.Personalized Designs and CustomizationOne of the most significant ways AI is being leveraged in the jewelry-making process is in the ideation phase. AI can quickly analyze customer preferences and compare that information to current industry trends and historical sales data to generate a unique design concept that’s tailored to a specific individual. The technology greatly reduces the amount of time needed to design jewelry and opens the door for greater customer participation and personalization during the design process, as AI can easily use keywords to generate different colors and styles.Virtual Try-On ExperiencesAI has also led to the birth of virtual try-on experiences which are completely changing the way consumers shop for jewelry online and in stores. Thanks to hyper-realistic AR technology, customers can see AI-generated images that demonstrate how the piece would look on them. This virtual test helps them feel more confident about committing to a certain bracelet or pair of earrings, and it also reduces the number of returns.Enhanced Creativity and Design PossibilitiesAI jewelry software is also boosting creativity. Jewelry designers are no longer limited by their own knowledge and experience. Using AI jewelry software, they can now enter design parameters and create multiple AI-generated concepts in less than half the time it would have taken to create concepts manually.Additionally, AI isn’t human, so sometimes it will generate shapes or textures that are unconventional. These accidental details can often be the springboard a jewelry designer needs to create never-before-seen designs that will help them stand out from other designers in the market.AI in Jewelry Production and Supply ChainAI jewelry design is just the beginning. Supply chains around the world are seeing dramatic decreases in operational costs and improved efficiency thanks to AI’s superior decision-making and analytical abilities. Globally, AI adoption has more than doubled since 2017, and the jewelry supply chain has not been a slow adopter. Here are just three ways advances in AI are impacting jewelry production and supply chain for the better:Streamlined Production ProcessesOptimization is one of the biggest benefits of jewelry AI. Using predictive analytics and machine learning, AI is streamlining operations at every stage of the supply chain. Because of its advanced pattern recognition capabilities, it can spot bottle",

In recent years, rapid advancements in technology- particularly artificial intelligence (AI)-have been transforming various sectors, and the jewelry industry is no exception. By leveraging AI technologies, businesses have revolutionized their operations within this traditional industry, driving innovation, efficiency, and personalized customer experiences.Enhanced Personalization: One of the most significant ways AI reshapes the jewelry industry is through personalized customer experiences. To understand individual preferences, AI-powered systems analyze vast customer data, including browsing history, purchase behavior, and social media interactions. This enables jewelry businesses to offer tailored product recommendations, increasing customer satisfaction and brand loyalty.Virtual Try-Ons: The jewelry industry often needs help with the inability of customers to physically try on products before purchasing. AI-driven virtual try-on solutions provide an immersive and interactive experience, allowing customers to wear jewelry pieces virtually and visualize their appearance in real life. This technology not only improves customer confidence in their purchases but also reduces the rate of returns, benefiting both customers and businesses.Efficient Inventory Management: Managing inventory is a crucial aspect of any retail business, and the jewelry industry is no different. AI-powered inventory management systems use predictive analytics to forecast demand, optimize stocking levels, and minimize excess inventory. This results in reduced costs and improved cash flow, ensuring that popular items are always in stock and enhancing overall operational efficiency.Quality Control and Authentication: Ensuring the authenticity and quality of precious metals and gemstones is paramount in the jewelry industry.

    "extractedText": "In a world where visual appeal drives buyer decisions, jewelers can no longer afford to rely solely on craftsmanship to stand out. The new competitive edge? Artificial Intelligence (AI). While AI might sound futuristic, it’s quickly becoming a must-have tool for independent jewelers looking to elevate their sales strategy, streamline their workflows, and captivate customers with breathtaking visuals. Are you leveraging AI to its full potential? Here’s how some of the industry’s top jewelers are using AI to drive sales — and how you can, too. 1. Transform Your Product Photography with AI In jewelry retail, visuals are everything. AI-powered photography tools now make it effortless to produce flawless, studio-quality images with just a click. Tools like GemCam Pro and GemLightbox streamline the entire photography process, from automatic lighting adjustment to background removal. Imagine capturing perfect shots of diamonds, gemstones, and intricate pieces without needing a photography team. AI handles the lighting balance, focus, and background cleanup for you — ensuring every image looks consistently polished and high-end. This not only elevates your brand image but also reduces return rates by setting accurate buyer expectations. 2. Streamline Workflows with Intelligent Automation Photography is just one part of the content creation process. Think about the hours spent editing, resizing, renaming, and uploading photos. AI can automate these tedious steps, freeing you up to focus on what truly matters — selling your jewelry. With the Gemlightbox Elite Kit, you can capture four images and one 360° video with a single click. AI then automatically generates product descriptions for your e-commerce store. Even e-commerce catalogs that help you sell directly to the client with personalised branding now only takes one click. What once took hours can now be done in minutes, enabling you to push more content faster and maintain a consistent look across all platforms. 3. Data-Driven Decisions for Smarter Sales AI isn’t just about photos — it’s about insights. Imagine knowing which products are most likely to sell based on customer engagement data. AI tools can analyze viewer interactions, social media engagement, and sales data to reveal which items are generating the most interest. Armed with this data, jewelers can adjust marketing strategies, highlight trending pieces, and launch targeted campaigns that speak directly to customer preferences — all without the guesswork. 4. Seamless Brand Presentation Across Channels Maintaining a consistent look across your website, Etsy shop, and Instagram feed can be a challenge. AI makes it easier to standardize how your products appear across all platforms—ensuring each item reflects the same polish, lighting, and clarity, no matter where it’s viewed. Brand consistency improves recognition and credibility. In fact, businesses that present their brand consistently across all channels see up to 33% more revenue than those that don’t. For jewelers, that can translate into higher trust, better customer retention, and more repeat sales. Introducing a New Era in Jewelry Photography As AI continues to shape the future of the jewelry industry. Jewelers, diamond and gemstones dealers now have access to tools that combine automation, precision, and beauty in one solution.

    "extractedText": "How AI is Reshaping the Diamond Industry: From Grading to Trading and the Customer Experience By RapNet Published: October 30, 2025 Share: The diamond industry is at a turning point. Consumer trust is harder to secure, provenance requirements are tightening, and competition from lab-grown stones is pushing every part of the value chain to demonstrate value more transparently. AI is emerging as a practical response to these pressures, not as a future promise, but as a tool already being used to analyze stones, verify origin, accelerate design, and improve customer experience. This post explores the areas where AI is already delivering commercial results, from grading accuracy to customer conversion, and offers guidance to help diamond traders, retailers, and brands evaluate which technologies may strengthen their business. AI in Grading, Provenance, and Compliance One of the biggest challenges in the diamond industry is proving stones’ value and legitimacy. Consumer expectations, regulatory requirements, and competition from lab-grown diamonds are all pushing the trade toward greater transparency. AI is emerging as a practical way to deliver that transparency, offering objective grading, traceable provenance, and verifiable data that can be trusted across borders. AI-Powered Grading: Bringing Consistency and Scalability to Diamond Evaluation Diamond grading has always relied on expert human judgment, but even among professionals, assessments can vary across labs or regions. Bringing in AI to help with diamond grading can create consistency and minimize these discrepancies. AI-based systems identify inclusions and measure their size, location, and impact on brilliance using standardized criteria. For example, Sarine’s Galaxy system maps internal features in three dimensions, allowing manufacturers to understand a diamond’s full potential before cutting. Similarly, platforms like Gemtelligence can detect subtle variations in symmetry and proportions that influence light performance, details that may not be visible to the human eye but have a measurable impact on value. The result is a diamond grading process that is faster, more consistent, and supported by verifiable data. AI for Provenance Verification and Ethical Compliance As diamond grading becomes more data-driven, origin is being held to the same standard. The market – and regulators – is no longer satisfied with knowing what a diamond is, but increasingly where it came from and whether that journey can be independently verified. AI technologies are enabling this shift. Tools that combine nano-laser inscription, chemical fingerprinting, and blockchain tracking give each stone a digital identity that cannot be altered once recorded. Systems such as Opsydia can etch a code beneath the surface of a diamond, imperceptible to the naked eye, that links to a verified record of origin, ownership, and movement across the supply chain. Generative AI in Jewelry Design and Manufacturing Design has traditionally been one of the most time-consuming phases of jewelry production. Concept development, client approvals, and CAD iterations often stretch timelines and increase costs. Jewelry designers can use generative AI to scale creativity, moving from initial idea to prototype more quickly, while improving alignment with consumer preferences and reducing wasted effort. Faster Concept Development with AI-Assisted Jewelry Design Generative AI allows designers to move from a verbal idea or rough concept to a visual rendering in minutes. Instead of starting with a blank page, they can generate multiple variations instantly, experimenting with stone cuts, metal types, and setting styles in real time. The designer still makes the aesthetic and technical decisions, but the early concept development stage becomes faster and more flexible. Tools like Midjourney and Firefly are being used in this way across the industry, not to replace creativity but to give it more room to expand. Jewelry designers can use AI tools to make the design process faster. [Source: ID 322654334 © BiancoBlue | Dreamstime.com] Customization and Client Co-Creation Personalization is becoming a defining factor in fine jewelry sales. AI tools make it possible to include the client directly in the jewelry design process, adjusting features during a consultation and immediately visualizing the results. For example, AI-enhanced CAD platforms such as MatrixGold now allow a designer to change stone shape, setting style, or band design in real time while the client watches their ideas take form. Similarly, interactive platforms like JWEEL let clients explore gemstone and metal combinations through an AI-guided interface. This reduces time spent on revisions and increases emotional investment in the final piece. For jewelry retailers and designers, this capability helps convert interest into commitment much earlier in the buying journey.

AI technologies are being used for things like product recommendations, automated customer support and personalised shopping experiences. Rise of Omnichannel Selling: Omnichannel selling is an approach that combines different sales channels - think physical stores, online channels, social media, etc - into one seamless shopping experience. By seamlessly combining different points of service into one technically integrated system, businesses can provide an immersive and personalised shopping experience.

It is interesting to see e-commerce businesses testing innovative and emerging platforms like ChatGPT and Amazon, which could potentially play a crucial role in preparing and boosting sales during this key period,\" says Samir El-Sabini, CEO and Co-Founder at Juni. \"Ad spend naturally increases in Q4 as businesses run more marketing campaigns, but a 67% increase YoY signals that businesses have to spend more to see results in this challenging climate. With a strong focus on delivering personalised customer experiences, e-commerce companies can strategically position themselves for success during the busiest time of the year.\"The launch of Amazon’s offsite ads programme took it head to head with Google and Meta, likely helping it to rapidly boost its market share. In one quarter, Amazon has raced ahead of Microsoft, TikTok and Snapchat as the third-ranked advertising platform, with ad share rising 3.5X from 1.7% in Q2 2023 to 6.1% in Q3 2022. This increase was primarily fuelled by consumer goods focused retailers, who spent the most on the platform, with food and beverage following second, and the consulting sector ranking third. Overall, Meta remains the dominant platform and is consolidating its place on the leaderboard with its market share rising steadily, from 52% in Q2 to 60% in Q3. Google came in second once again, but despite there remaining a sizeable gap to Meta, Google was the long-term winner. It saw a 7.4% increase in ad spend on its platform year on year, going from a 19.2% share of overall ad spend in Q3 2022 to 26.6% in Q3 2023. TikTok fell to fourth position with 3.2% of total ad budgets in Q3 2023, a notable drop from 5.56% in Q2 2023. Nonetheless, the UK market remains the top market for this platform, as the rest of Europe only allocated 2.3% of their budget to the mobile-first platform. Similarly, ad shares for SnapChat and Microsoft have also fallen from Q2 to Q3 but only incrementally as SnapChat’s share fell by 0.19% to 1% and Microsoft's by 0.25% to 1.5%. E-commerce businesses’ overall spend has jumped 42% year-on-year, with ad spend increasing by 67%.
