Instead, retailers should look to AI to help them win across digital and in-store. As we head into the latter half of 2024, competition in luxury goods markets remains fierce. Consumer expectations around high levels of personalization continue to rise and brands are recognizing the ever-increasing importance of their digital presence, including on the web and via social media. A recent report from Deloitte into the Swiss watch sector, for example, noted that social selling is set to become a “key sub-channel for the industry”. It also found that 45% of brands identified developing or strengthening their omnichannel strategies as a strong priority, while 41% want to develop their e-commerce or digital channels. Against the backdrop of heightened customer expectations, brands need to go beyond traditional e-commerce sites, blanket marketing emails and generic social campaigns. Instead, smart businesses are looking to artificial intelligence to help them win across digital and in-store, by offering hyper-personalized experiences, fitting of a luxury brand. Why now is the time to invest in hyper-personalization Luxury businesses are optimistic about growth prospects in many of the world’s markets. The aforementioned Deloitte report found that executives were particularly positive about opportunities in India, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. The report also rightly notes that while inflation does not generally affect those buying high-end luxury products, the fact that it is falling in many of the main luxury goods markets is a good sign for those selling products in the sub-£500 range. The coming months are therefore the perfect time for luxury businesses to double-down on AI-driven hyper-personalization. Let’s look at what this involves. The two pillars of AI in hyper-personalized customer experiences There are two parts to the solution. Firstly, luxury brands need to be leveraging AI to mine new customer insights from their data. AI can spot patterns, anomalies and other hidden knowledge in large and/or unstructured bodies of data. From these findings, AI can then predict what customers are likely to want to do next at key points in their journey. This is where the second AI pillar then comes in: generating hyper-personalized customer experiences at speed, in response to customers’ interactions. Luxury brands can use generative AI to produce content such as text, images, audio, and video, near-enough on-the-fly, to craft highly personalized journeys. These can be incorporated into every stage of your customer-facing offering, creating a stronger brand experience right from the initial marketing, through to the sale, and then afterwards to drive loyalty and repeat purchases. The blend of AI to segment your target market down to the individual level, coupled with the generative AI capabilities to produce the experiences, mean it is now possible to target in ways and at scales that were simply impossible before. How do you get started? At this point, you would be forgiven for feeling both excited by the opportunity, and unsure of how to take your next steps. However, the process does not need to feel overwhelming. As with so many things, dividing the challenge into smaller chunks is the key. Our approach is to segment it into people, process, data, and technology. People: Multi-skilled teams drive successWhen you mention AI, businesses tend to think ‘we need data scientists.’ But if you have tried to hire multi-skilled data scientists, you will know these specialists are few and far between. Demand for their skills far outstrips supply, meaning you are unlikely to meet your AI-driven growth targets if you rely solely on building a full team of data scientists. Instead, craft multi-skilled data science teams with domain knowledge, covering three main skillsets: investigators, builders, and story-tellers. Investigators include statistics and probability specialists, who can make your data talk. Builders are the AI, machine learning and MLOps engineers, who create the scalable code and pipelines that underpin your AI-based solutions. The story-tellers turn the findings into actionable business insights and customer experiences. Process: Get comfortable with failing fastNot all the AI use cases you investigate will prove fruitful, and you don’t want to waste money on those that aren’t going to deliver value. So instead of going deep in one or two areas, trial a ran",

    "extractedText": "Assess→Atrophy→Ascend→ Assess The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into luxury retail marks a significant evolution in how brands interact with and cater to their clientele. This technological shift is not merely about optimizing sales; it represents a fundamental reimagining of the luxury experience itself. At its core, AI-driven personalization in this sector seeks to create bespoke interactions, anticipating individual desires and preferences with a precision previously unattainable. This ambition extends beyond simple product recommendations, aiming to touch every facet of the customer journey, from initial online browsing to post-purchase engagement and loyalty programs. The promise is a seamless, hyper-individualized experience that mirrors the exclusivity and attention to detail traditionally associated with luxury. AI-driven personalization in luxury retail is about creating bespoke customer interactions through advanced technological forecasting of individual preferences. Currently, the landscape of AI in luxury retail is characterized by a spectrum of applications. Predictive analytics are employed to forecast trends and manage inventory, ensuring that coveted items are available to the right customers at the right time. Machine learning algorithms analyze vast datasets of consumer behavior → purchase history, browsing patterns, social media activity, and even geographical data → to discern individual tastes and anticipate future purchases. Chatbots, powered by natural language processing (NLP), offer instant, personalized customer service, mimicking the attentive assistance of a dedicated sales associate. Furthermore, AI is enhancing the online shopping experience through dynamic content personalization, tailoring website layouts, product displays, and marketing messages to individual user profiles. In physical stores, AI is starting to play a role through facial recognition technology to identify returning customers and provide staff with immediate access to their purchase history and preferences, facilitating a more personalized in-person interaction. These technologies are not deployed in isolation; rather, they are increasingly integrated to create a holistic, AI-powered ecosystem designed to elevate the luxury shopping experience. Data Landscape and Predictive Patterns The efficacy of AI-driven personalization hinges on the availability of robust and granular data. Luxury retailers are increasingly sophisticated in their data collection strategies, amassing information from diverse touchpoints. Online interactions provide a rich vein of data, capturing browsing behavior, wish list creations, abandoned carts, and responses to marketing campaigns. CRM systems integrate purchase histories, loyalty program activity, and customer service interactions. Social media listening tools offer insights into brand sentiment, trending preferences, and influencer engagement. Even in-store experiences are becoming data-rich, with technologies like beacon tracking, RFID tagging, and point-of-sale systems contributing to a comprehensive customer profile. This deluge of data is then analyzed using advanced statistical methods and machine learning techniques to identify predictive patterns. These patterns are not merely correlations; they represent complex relationships between consumer attributes, behaviors, and preferences. For example, AI can discern that customers who have previously purchased certain brands of watches are likely to be interested in specific types of leather goods or that individuals who engage with sustainable fashion content on social media are more receptive to marketing messages highlighting eco-friendly product lines. Behavioral patterns extend beyond purchase history to encompass browsing sequences, time spent on product pages, and interactions with different types of content. Multi-dimensional patterns consider a confluence of factors → demographic data, psychographic profiles, lifestyle indicators, and even contextual variables like location and time of year → to create a holistic understanding of individual customers. The sophistication of these analytical models is constantly evolving, driven by advancements in AI research and the increasing availability of computational power. The goal is to move beyond broad generalizations and achieve a level of personalization that feels genuinely individual and anticipates needs before they are explicitly articulated. Sustainability Baseline in Luxury Retail Examining the current sustainability baseline in luxury retail reveals a sector at a critical juncture. Historically, luxury has been associated with exclusivity, craftsmanship, and timeless design, but not necessarily with environmental or social responsibility. However, growing consumer awareness and demand for ethical and sustainable practices are compelling luxury brands to re-evaluate their operations. The current state is characterized by a mixture of nascent initiatives a",

ChatGPT is only one consumer-friendly example of generative AI, a technology comprising algorithms that can be used to create new content, including audio, code, images, text, simulations, and videos. Rather than simply identifying and classifying information, generative AI creates new information by leveraging foundation models, which are deep learning models that can handle multiple complex tasks at the same time. Examples include GPT-3.5 and DALL-E. (For more on generative AI and machine learning, see “[What is generative AI?](/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers/what-is-generative-ai)”1“[What is generative AI?](/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers/what-is-generative-ai)” McKinsey, January 19, 2023.  and “[Generative AI is here: How tools like ChatGPT could change your business](/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/generative-ai-is-here-how-tools-like-chatgpt-could-change-your-business).”2Michael Chui, Roger Roberts, and Lareina Yee, “[Generative AI is here: How tools like ChatGPT could change your business](/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/generative-ai-is-here-how-tools-like-chatgpt-could-change-your-business),” McKinsey, December 20, 2022.)\n\nWhile the fashion industry has experimented with basic AI and other frontier technologies—the metaverse, nonfungible tokens (NFTs), digital IDs, and augmented or virtual reality come to mind—it has so far had little experience with generative AI. True, this nascent technology became broadly available only recently and is still rife with worrisome kinks and bugs, but all indications are that it could improve at lightning speed and become a game changer in many aspects of business. In the next three to five years, generative AI could add $150 billion, conservatively, and up to $275 billion to the apparel, fashion, and luxury sectors’ operating profits, according to McKinsey analysis. From codesigning to speeding content development processes, generative AI creates new space for creativity. It can input all forms of “unstructured” data—raw text, images, and video—and output new forms of media, ranging from fully-written scripts to 3-D designs and realistic virtual models for video campaigns.\n\nThese are still early days, but some clear use cases for generative AI in fashion have already emerged. (Many of these use cases also apply to the adjacent beauty and luxury sectors.) Within product innovation, marketing, and sales and customer experience in particular, the technology can have significant outcomes and may be more feasible to implement in the short term compared with other areas in the fashion value chain.

The fusion of AI with fashion, particularly Generative AI, is reshaping the industry in unprecedented ways, giving birth to a wave of opportunities and innovations. From trend prediction to redefining customer interactions, let's embark on a journey through the captivating evolution of fashion with the prowess of Gen AI.AI's Impact on the Fashion IndustryWith personalization emerging as a key driver of customer satisfaction, the market landscape is shifting tides. The convergence of data-driven insights with AI now enables retailers to better understand consumer behavior, leading to more targeted marketing strategies, improved inventory management, and better customer service. The numbers tell a compelling story of AI's impact on the fashion industry. A report by Globe Newswire suggests that the global market for Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Fashion is projected to reach a size of US$16.3 billion by 2030. Moreover, according to Forbes, nearly two-thirds (64%) of business owners believe AI will improve customer relationships.Runway to Real Life: Real-world use cases of Gen AI in FashionThe world of fashion is witnessing an AI-driven makeover that's turning heads and capturing hearts. Here’s an outline of various fashion industry segments catching the ripple effect of Generative AI:Virtual Dressing RoomsImagine trying on outfits virtually before making a purchase. ASOS, a global fashion retailer, utilizes AR and AI to create virtual dressing rooms, allowing customers to visualize how clothes fit and look on their bodies in the comfort of their homes.Sustainable Fashion DesignBeyond fashion's aesthetics, AI is playing a pivotal role in fostering sustainable practices. From optimizing supply chains to reducing waste through accurate demand forecasting, AI is helping the fashion industry become more eco-friendly. Sustainable fashion startups are using AI to source ethical materials, track a product's lifecycle, and even recycle old garments into new designs. These practices not only align with consumer demand for ethical practices but also position brands as champions of environmental responsibility. Zara's efficient value chains and Alibaba's AI-powered manufacturing ecosystem are gaining traction in smart production. Alibaba’s system groups items of the same material from diverse orders and brands for collective processing. Its AI-driven fabric cutter maximizes cloth utilization, and every raw material gets a unique ID and QR code for traceability.Retailers ReimaginedAI-powered algorithms enable retailers to analyze vast data sets and predict trends, leading to smarter inventory management and more informed decisions on what to stock. eBay's ShopBot, powered by generative AI, helps customers sift through its vast billion-plus listings to find the best deals. Users can interact with the bot using text, voice, or photos, and the bot engages in further conversations to refine its recommendations. Retailers can now be empowered to make the best of customer data and enhance personalization through Generative AI to foster brand loyalty.Predicting Fashion TrendsAI's ability to analyze vast amounts of data has revolutionized trend prediction. By scouring social media, runway shows, and fashion publications, AI algorithms can identify emerging trends and consumer preferences in real-time. This data-driven insight empowers brands and designers to create collections aligned with the current zeitgeist, reducing the risk of producing items that might not resonate with the market. This not only improves inventory turnover but also helps brands stay ahead in a highly competitive industry. A Sweden-based multinational clothing brand, H&M uses AI algorithms to analyze social media posts, runway images, and even weather forecasts to predict upcoming fashion trends. This insight helps them design and stock products aligned with consumer preferences.Supply Chain EnhancementRetail giants like Zara are using AI to forecast demand accurately. This has led to minimized overstocking, reduced waste, and, ultimately, more sustainable practices. Powerful simulation tools such as CLO 3D allow designers to create and visualize digital garments in a realistic 3D environment alongside insights that indicate waste reduction and required material quantities before the designs go into production.Fashion Design InnovationThe creative process is evolving as AI assists designers. Brands like IBM and Marchesa collaborated to create the world's first AI-generated gown, blending technology and haute couture.

    "extractedText": "July 13, 2023Generative AI in E-commerce: 6 Top Use Cases By Liza Colburn Generative AI is the biggest thing in e-commerce since free two-day shipping. It’s transformed everything from the digital shopping experience to back office operations and everything in between. Generative AI in e-commerce not only makes marketing and operations more efficient, it also brings the in-store experience online in ways that bring added value to customers. 70% of the US population shops online. Globally, there are over 2.14 billion online shoppers as of 2023. While the convenience and simplicity of shopping from home 24/7 365 days a year continues to fuel the growth of e-commerce, shoppers still want the personalized, interactive experiences that they receive in-store. Key ways retail leaders use Generative AI in e-commerce Let’s explore a few ways top brands use Generative AI to get to know their customers better and provide the interactive digital customer experiences their shoppers want. 1. AI Chatbots Business hours simply do not apply to an online storefront. Slow responses to customers can result in lost sales. Non-availability can even be perceived by customers as disinterest from the brand. Response speed is just as significant as availability. According to HubSpot Research, 90% of customers rate an immediate response as important or very important when they have a customer service question. Chatbots, particularly AI chatbots, help e-commerce brands connect with customers instantly, no matter what time of day or day of the year it is. There are three types of chatbots: AI chatbots that use natural language processing to sound more human, enhancing the e-commerce customer experience while being less robotic and more helpful. Rules-based chatbots that answer predefined questions. Hybrid chatbots that combine the two. While round the clock coverage is no longer a nice to have, but a must-have for e-commerce, brands must choose a chatbot and an e-commerce chatbot strategy that resolves customer’s questions rather than deflect them. The best digital strategies bring together humans and AI. So while an AI chatbot will become even more helpful and conversational as it learns, it won’t replace human agents, but rather add hours and scale to the customer experience. The relationship between humans and AI should always be a collaboration rather than a competition. 2. High-performing digital messaging E-commerce brands often miss out on opportunities to connect with customers on a human level. Customers want to feel like the brands they shop know them, no matter what digital channel or stage of the customer journey they happen to be on. Not to mention, customer preferences change faster than ever, which often leaves brands with outdated messaging that no longer performs. To compete for the attention of digital-first customers, brand messaging needs to consistently inspire customers to take action in the moment and tap into emotions. Inspiration isn’t accomplished through digital marketing copy that “sounds good” and is on-brand—that’s a given. What brands need is for the messaging to drive performance (i.e. conversions, sales, email opens, etc.). According to a recent Persado study of 250 retail marketers, even the most experienced digital marketers only pick the highest-performing messaging around one third of the time. That’s where Generative AI comes in. While most Generative AI tools can easily create copy that meets the brand guidelines and is conversational, Persado Motivation AI takes AI-generated messaging one critical step further. Motivation AI, a specialized class of Generative AI created exclusively for enterprise marketing and e-commerce teams, provides brands with both efficiency and effectiveness. Motivation AI is trained on over 1.5 billion customer interactions from 150 million US customers. This data is used to create AI-generated digital marketing messaging that motivates customers to convert at key moments—including in the online cart. As seen in the real life example below, more customers purchased sweaters at a lower discount because of the performance-driven AI-generated messaging. Kate Spade, too, has benefited from Persado by enhancing e-commerce retention and loyalty with its Generative AI. 3. Content and image creation Customers shopping online can’t physically see or touch items. So images and videos are vital to sell products. Brands need high quality images for every product. With the help of Generative AI, companies can list products faster, as they no longer have to wait for studios or photographers to be available in order to quickly generate or edit product images at scale. AI-generated backgrounds save e-commerce teams time and money on set dressing and location hunting. Generative AI image tools also help brands mock up photos, brainstorm visual ideas, and edit user-generated content. 4.

Today, text and images represent the pinnacle applications of this technology. Across different domains and industries, there is a unified drive to broaden its application to fields such as animation, sound effects, music, integrating virtual characters, and leveraging AI in fashion for collection design. How can Gen-AI be applied to the fashion industry? From the 2023 AI Fashion Week to Casablanca’s AI-generated campaign, the fashion industry has been one of the most explorative with the technology. Projects are being done in collaboration with agencies like Maison Meta and Lalaland.ai and sometimes in combination with domain-specific software. According to McKinsey, generative AI could increase the apparel, fashion, and luxury industries’ profit by $275 billion in the following three to five years. One of the most common use cases tested in the brand and retail industries involves marketing automation with companies like Pimento for marketing imagery inspiration, Writer for SEO or e-commerce content optimization, and Jasper AI for copywriting. For instance, Casablanca used the technology for its S/S 2023 marketing campaign. Another tested use case has been around online shopping assistance and customer service tailored to shopping. Companies like Kering, a luxury group, and Zalando, an online fashion retailer, launched a chatbot using ChatGPT to give product recommendations. Finally, product design is also seen as one of the use cases with the most potential, given the nature of the technology to support creativity, give answers, or provide newness. McKinsey highlights that design and product manufacturing are where technology will bring the most value. This is also supported by BCG’s study, stating that using AI for creative innovation performed about 40% better than a control group that did not use it. Conversely, participants who used AI for business problem-solving performed 23% worse than the control group. Product design is a critical step in manufacturing for any physical consumer product company. The current process involves a combination of methods and tools depending on the industry and the designer’s personal and preferred creative process. According to Business of Fashion, generative AI is a strategic priority for 73% of fashion executives, and 28% have tested it in the design and product development processes. Looking at the current design process, almost every product is built, starting with an inspirational phase, then building prototypes, and then the development phase. Using AI can help designers be inspired by getting more ideas. The added value comes mainly from AI models being able to ingest a large amount of data like trends, past collections, and customer interests to provide ideas. Many brands have explored the use of this technology to build collections and products, especially in 2023. The benefits of the technology can vary depending on whether a fast-fashion or luxury brand uses it. Fast-fashion or mid-market brands can use generative AI to create more designs based on the latest trends. In contrast, luxury companies might use it more at the start of the process purely for mood board visualization using different sources of inspiration. One can say that the challenge of using the technology is that the final rendering does not reach current standards in terms of structure or design. However, these tools should be used in parallel with human creativity. Some designers mention that “hallucinations” or errors made by AI systems can also be a source of inspiration. Who are the space's key players, and how do they tackle AI in fashion? The use of gen-AI is still in its early stages, given that it has been less than two years since tools have been developed and commercialized. In product design, solutions are at an even earlier stage due to the diversity of products to adapt to - for instance, cars, jewelry, and furniture. Currently, the market is structured between existing design tools, like Cala, that integrate gen-AI as an added feature, and emerging companies purely focused on asset generation, like cre[ai]tion or Raspberry AI. Using gen-AI can also serve benefits for optimized customization. Indeed, by integrating consumers’ preferences from first-party data collection or their own inputs like images and text, brands can create a new type of consumer relationship by manufacturing personalized products. Raspberry AI is even more focused on the fashion industry, providing market search for trends detection to accompany designers right fro",

As we progress through 2025, these technologies are already proving instrumental in streamlining operations, optimising supply chains, and delivering unprecedented personalisation in customer service. This trend is only set to continue as technology develops and evolves at a rapid rate, with more and more retailers and suppliers embracing its capabilities. AI and automation: Transforming jewellery retail in 2025 The evolution of inventory management Duncan Fergusson, managing director of Sci-Net The jewellery sector’s unique characteristics — high-value items, seasonal demand fluctuations, and emotional purchase drivers — have historically made inventory management particularly challenging. Today though, advanced algorithms are transforming how retailers approach stock control, creating more efficient and responsive systems. Although not quite in widespread play yet, modern AI-powered inventory management systems are set to revolutionise how jewellers maintain optimal stock levels. These sophisticated platforms will combine analysis of historical sales data and seasonal trends with real-time consumer behaviour to accurately predict demand — painting an up-to-date picture that gives retailers unprecedented insight. This predictive capability will enable jewellery retailers to maintain ideal stock levels, thereby reducing the chances of overstocking and/or stockouts that can lead to lost sales opportunities. It also offers major benefits to suppliers too, as it can provide forecasted requirements, thereby speeding up the time to market as suppliers can make products in advance. Real-time inventory tracking is something that has become increasingly sophisticated over time, with automated systems monitoring stock levels across multiple locations and multiple channels. When inventory reaches predetermined thresholds, automated reordering processes are triggered — helping to ensure consistent stock availability, whilst also minimising human error in the replenishment process. Another hugely beneficial development is promotional event modelling. For specific events, such as Black Friday, retailers will be able to ramp up stock levels using a promotional calendar, with AI determining an increase in cover through analysis of historic throughput based on the type of promotion. Transforming the supply chain The jewellery supply chain has traditionally been complex. Involving numerous stakeholders — from refiners to manufacturers to retailers — it also requires the careful tracking of precious materials. Automation is streamlining these processes, introducing new levels of efficiency and transparency, as well as enhanced security. Modern supply chain management systems provide improved visibility throughout the entire journey — from raw material sourcing to final delivery. This transparency not only improves efficiency, it also addresses growing consumer demand for ethical sourcing and sustainability in the jewellery industry. Automated logistics systems are another aspect revolutionising order fulfilment, with advanced warehousing solutions enabling faster and more accurate processing. These systems reduce handling times, while minimising errors and optimising shipping routes — all of which helps to secure significant cost savings, while seeing improved customer satisfaction at the same time. Elevating the customer experience Perhaps the most visible impact of AI in jewellery retail is in its enhancement of the customer experience. The implementation of virtual try-on technology — powered by advanced AI algorithms — is transforming how customers shop for jewellery. These systems allow customers to visualise how pieces will look before making a purchase, playing into the emotional aspect. People can truly appreciate the look of any prospective jewellery they are intending to buy, encouraging them to commit to the purchase due to the simple fact that they like what they see. An added benefit is that this significantly reduces return rates, while also increasing customer confidence in online purchases. The ability to try something on is one of the core benefits of shopping on the high street and now those retailers who are purely online can tap into what has traditionally been a powerful tool of persuasion previously outside of their reach. The benefits don’t stop there though, with AI-driven personalisation extending beyond virtual try-ons. Sophisticated recommendation engines analyse customer preferences based on their purchase history and their browsing behaviour to suggest pieces that align with their individual tastes. I am sure most readers are familiar with online adverts following you around based on items you have previously viewed, but this level of personalisation is only set to increase — and it is something that c",

    "snippet": "Large language models (LLMs) change how consumers acquire information online; their bots also crawl news publishers' websites for training",
    "domain": "arxiv.org",
    "extractedText": "The Impact of LLMs on Online News Consumption and Production Hangcheng Zhao Rutgers Business School. hangcheng.zhao@rutgers.edu Ron Berman The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. ronber@wharton.upenn.edu (December 2025 ) Abstract Large language models (LLMs) change how consumers acquire information online; their bots also crawl news publishers’ websites for training data and to answer consumer queries; and they provide tools that can lower the cost of content creation. These changes lead to predictions of adverse impact on news publishers in the form of lowered consumer demand, reduced demand for newsroom employees, and an increase in news “slop.” Consequently, some publishers strategically responded by blocking LLM access to their websites using the robots.txt file standard. Using high-frequency granular data, we document four effects related to the predicted shifts in news publishing following the introduction of generative AI (GenAI). First, we find a moderate decline in traffic to news publishers occurring after August 2024. Second, using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that blocking GenAI bots can be associated with a reduction of total website traffic to large publishers compared to not blocking. Third, on the hiring side, we do not find evidence that LLMs are replacing editorial or content-production jobs yet. The share of new editorial and content-production job listings increases over time. Fourth, regarding content production, we find no evidence that large publishers increased text volume; instead, they significantly increased rich content and use more advertising and targeting technologies. Together, these findings provide early evidence of some unforeseen impacts of the introduction of LLMs on news production and consumption. Keywords: Large language models, Generative AI, News production, News consumption, Online News Publishers, Staggered Difference-in-Differences, Synthetic Difference-in-Differences, Labor demand, AI Slop, Digital Media 1 Introduction Generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs) are reshaping how consumers discover and consume information online. Unlike search-based discovery intermediaries (e.g., Google) that primarily redirect users to publishers through links, LLM-mediated interfaces can directly provide answers and summaries, potentially substituting away from click-through visits.111The Economist, “AI is killing the web. Can anything save it?” https://www.economist.com/business/2025/07/14/ai-is-killing-the-web-can-anything-save-it, accessed Dec 18, 2025. Recent evidence shows that LLM adoption reduces traditional search activity and downstream browsing to smaller sites, and users click external links less often when AI summaries appear in search results.222Pew Research Center 2025, “Google users are less likely to click on links when an AI summary appears in the results,” https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/07/22/google-users-are-less-likely-to-click-on-links-when-an-ai-summary-appears-in-the-results/, accessed Dec 18, 2025. These developments raise a few interesting questions: (1) to what extent does generative AI function as a substitute for publisher traffic and monetization? (2) how do publishers respond? and (3) is this response effective? News publishers have been at the center of the debate about the impact of LLMs because LLMs use news content to improve their model training and also to answer user queries. Since the business model of news publishers depends heavily on discovery and referral from intermediaries, some publishers have been quick to respond by blocking LLM access to their websites using the robots.txt standard.333RFC 9309 https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9309.html, accessed Dec 18, 2025. The impact of this blocking can be three-fold: it can reduce bot traffic from LLMs used to scan the websites to train models; it can reduce bot traffic by LLMs used to answer user queries; and it can reduce referral traffic by LLMs sending users to visit the news publisher. Publishers can also try to respond by lowering headcount which would save costs, or by increasing content production using LLMs to attract more consumers. Given these different potential effects, it remains less understood (1) what the overall impact of LLMs on publisher traffic is; (2) whether blocking access is an effective strategic response; and (3) how LLM tools affect the supply of news content by publishers through hiring decisions and changes in the quantity and format of content they produce. We address these questions by constructing a high-frequency, publisher panel that links daily traffic to strategic blocking rules for LLM crawlers, publishers’ page structure, and publishers’ hiring. We combine daily domain-level visits from SimilarWeb with historical robots.txt files and HTML snapshots from the HTTP Archive and employer-linked job postings from Revelio. To separate total visits to publishers (which may include bot and crawler traffic",

Although GenAI explicitly accounts for only 5% of these deals, don’t be fooled into thinking it’s not significant. Much of the excitement around GenAI has taken place in the last year. Its ability to improve and combine with other technologies means that it has progressed rapidly through its own hype cycle and become a key consideration in the consumer market. We are already seeing use cases cascade throughout consumer businesses, ranging from faster and cheaper marketing to highly automated contracting processes. A breakdown of the identified consumer AI-related M&A deals shows them spanning the entire enterprise, with one-third related to sourcing and procurement at one end of the value chain, and one-fifth helping drive sales and last-mile solutions at the other end. While current perceptions of GenAI typically see it as a functional toolset which can be leveraged to provide solutions to a range of individual business needs, the real power will be realized when organizations start to view it as an enterprise enabler for their own business transformation.

And what does their failure reveal about the gap between technical capability and commercial success?Sam Altman admitted that OpenAI’s model names are “letter-and-number salad,” a stark acknowledgment that his company cannot communicate its product hierarchy clearly to customers. This isn’t false modesty. When your CEO concedes that buyers struggle to understand your product naming, you’ve moved beyond poor marketing into strategic dysfunction affecting conversion rates and enterprise adoption. The GPT-5 solution, which provided a wrapper which was then subsequently unwrapped did not resolve the problem.The problem extends across the entire LLM sector. Research analyzing AI models on Hugging Face documented how inconsistently the industry applies versioning principles that software companies established decades ago specifically to prevent this confusion. Meanwhile, DeepSeek recently achieved GPT-4 level performance at one-tenth the cost, proving that the assumed competitive advantages of massive computational scale were never as durable as Western providers believed.This convergence of crises—catastrophic brand management colliding with collapsing technical moats—defines the LLM market in late 2025.

Gary Drenik is a writer covering AI, analytics and innovation.Follow AuthorOct 07, 2025, 10:00am EDTAI SystemsGetty Images - Issarawat TattongArtificial intelligence is quickly becoming the foundation of efficiency in the world of retail — from demand forecasting and sales analysis to localized allocation and personalization. The technology is arriving on the scene just in time, promoting agile strategies as shopping behaviors shift faster than ever. Consumer confidence fell in August amid anxiety around unemployment and inflationary price adjustments. In response, retailers are building more responsive planning strategies to meet shoppers where they are, with products they are looking for, and AI is becoming central to that effort. Using AI, retailers can more accurately forecast sales trends, quickly respond to shifting consumer behaviors and preserve loyalty.Why Chatbots Shouldn’t Be a Top Area of AI Spending for RetailersData from a recent Prosper Insights & Analytics survey, shows that one-third of people ages 18 and up have heard of generative AI and are already using it, including more than 40% each of Gen-Z and Millennials, a third of Gen-Xers and more than 20% of Baby Boomers. Prosper - Heard of Generative AIProsper Insights & AnalyticsGiven consumers’ familiarity with generative AI and the cost savings associated with using AI for customer service functions, some retailers are spending heavily on generative AI chatbots in an effort to increase personalization for online shopping experiences. The global AI for customer service market was estimated to be $13 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach $84 billion by 2033. MORE FOR YOU“Of course, this isn’t the only use case for AI in retail, nor is it necessarily the most effective use of budget; consumers are very familiar with AI, but that doesn’t mean they want to deal with it when shopping,” commented Max Ma, CEO and Founder of 7thonline. According to Prosper Insights & Analytics, more than 70% of Americans ages 18 and older would prefer to speak to a live person rather than a generative chat program. “Until sentiment around AI for customer service changes, spending may be better focused on optimizing inventory and supply chains or enhancing merchandising strategies. These are use cases that directly impact the bottom line. Many retail executives recognize the benefits and untapped potential of AI in these areas and are already investing,” said Ma.Prosper - Prefer to Communicate with for Online ShoppingProsper Insights & AnalyticsStaying Ahead of ShoppersAccording to a recent 7thonline survey, one-third of retail executives are already using AI to forecast and analyze demand, while 34% expect it to play a major role in sustaining or growing profits over the next two years. Retailers aim to use AI to stay ahead of shoppers by predicting and capturing emerging trends.Today’s fast-moving retail landscape is marred by turbulence as consumers doubt their continued employment and ability to pay for things. Thus, retail success has come to depend on AI tools that are able to identify exactly what shoppers are looking for, when they are looking for it. The ability to analyze mass amounts of historical and current data in real time down to style, color, size is invaluable to stay ahead of shoppers. This enables retailers to remain agile and meet their business goals. According to 7thonline, a growing share of executives are investing in predictive technologies to anticipate shifts in consumer demand, with 54% either using AI or exploring AI options in this area.To reduce inventory risk, retailers are also taking tactical steps like cutting inventory levels and diversifying suppliers to preserve their margins, but their long-term focus is shifting toward smarter, more resilient merchandise planning. Data from 7thonline shows that responsive pricing strategies (20%) and speed to market (14%) top the list of merchandise planning investment priorities, reflecting a push to become more agile amid ongoing uncertainty on both the supply and demand side of retail.Driving Loyalty with AIA related challenge for retailers in the current environment is brand loyalty, especially among younger generations who are more likely to switch brands based on price and other qualifications, like value alignment. Forrester estimates that brand loyalty will decline 25% in 2025, adding that saving money is one of the top five reasons consumers in the U.S. will try a new brand.

From personalized shopping experiences to automated customer service, AI is no longer a futuristic concept. In fact, even global eCommerce giants like Amazon and Alibaba, and small businesses, have been adopting AI to compete on a bigger scale. Source: Shopify This rapid adoption is driven by AI’s ability to simplify processes, reduce operational costs, and enhance customer satisfaction. By analyzing customer behavior, predicting buying trends, and automating repetitive tasks, AI enables businesses to operate more efficiently and competitively. Key Takeaways 95% of eCommerce companies in the U.S. experienced a very good Return on Investment (ROI) when adopting AI technologies.

TABLE OF CONTENTS Key Takeaways 7 Benefits of AI in Online Retail How AI Enhances eCommerce Experiences Top AI Tools for eCommerce Platforms Implementation Best Practices Final Thoughts: Should You Invest Now? FAQs About AI for eCommerce 7 Benefits of AI in Online Retail The growing presence of AI in eCommerce is not just keeping up with technology trends, it’s also about having the business advantage. By combining automated data analytics and advanced algorithms, AI empowers online businesses to meet expectations faster, more innovative, and more effectively. Hyper-Personalized Customer Experiences AI can analyze real-time data to deliver tailored product recommendations, personalized emails, and dynamic landing pages. This includes browsing history, past purchases, and demographic details. In fact, Salesforce reports that 73% of consumers say treating them like an individual rather than a number is key to winning loyalty. This level of personalization increases engagement, average order value (AOV), and customer loyalty. 24/7 Intelligent Customer Support According to CX Today, Gartner predicted that AI-powered support can resolve up to 80% of common customer queries without human intervention. AI chatbots and virtual assistants handle common inquiries, such as order tracking, return policies, and product details, around the clock. This reduces response time from hours to seconds and frees up human agents for complex issues. Smarter Inventory and Supply Chain Management A Study showed that online retailers that use AI for inventory forecasting saw an average 52% improvement in accuracy, leading to a 45% reduction in excess inventory. Using predictive analytics, AI forecasts demand patterns based on seasonality, trends, and external factors (like weather or local events). This helps retailers optimize stock levels, prevent overstocking or stockouts, and improve fulfillment efficiency. Dynamic Pricing Optimization AI algorithms monitor competitor pricing, demand fluctuations, and user behavior to adjust prices in real time. This ensures competitiveness while maximizing profit margins, especially useful during flash sales or holiday seasons. For example, Amazon changes prices every 10 minutes on average, reported a significant increase in gross margins compared to static pricing models. Fraud Detection and Transaction Security Machine learning models detect unusual patterns in transactions, such as multiple failed attempts, mismatched billing addresses, or high-risk geolocations. This helps prevent chargebacks and protects both merchants and customers. This is what happened to JP Morgan, which uses AI-powered fraud shields to reduce scams by 40%. Enhanced Product Search and Discovery Traditional keyword searches are being replaced by AI-driven systems that understand natural language and visual cues. Features like visual search (upload a photo to find products) and semantic search (understanding intent behind queries) dramatically improve user experience. With AI-powered search, it can reduce bounce rates by up to 40% and increase average session duration. Automated Marketing and Campaign Optimization AI also optimizes marketing efforts by predicting which messages resonate best with specific customer segments. From email subject lines to ad targeting, tools like AI copywriters can generate product descriptions and promotional content in seconds. Businesses using AI for marketing report 3x faster campaign deployment and 40% higher ROI (Return on Investment) on ad spend. How AI ",

    "extractedText": "Lance Owide As AI continues to reshape the digital landscape, its impact on B2B ecommerce is profound. From optimizing operations to enhancing customer experience and driving growth, AI’s evolving role presents both challenges and opportunities for B2B manufacturing and distributing decision-makers. AI can help B2B organizations make informed decisions around dynamic pricing, demand forecasting, and buyer behavior predictions. The Current State of B2B Ecommerce B2B ecommerce is experiencing unprecedented growth. According to Grandview Research, in 2023 the global B2B ecommerce market was valued at $18.7 trillion, with projections indicating it will reach $57.6 trillion by 2030. This rapid expansion is driven by the increasing adoption of digital channels across B2B sectors, as businesses recognize the efficiency and scalability that ecommerce offers. As B2B ecommerce continues to grow, the integration of AI is becoming crucial. AI has the potential to act as a force multiplier for in-house teams, automating processes and providing data-driven insights that fuel strategic decision-making. To remain competitive in this evolving landscape, B2B organizations must invest in AI-driven solutions that optimize operations and enhance the buyer experience. Core Areas Where AI Can Make an Impact AI’s impact on B2B ecommerce spans business strategy, buyer experience and operations, with each area benefiting from its automation and predictive capabilities. Below are three ways AI can make a business impact. 1. Fuel Business Strategy AI-driven systems have the potential to revolutionize how B2B organizations approach their business strategy. One of the most valuable applications of AI is its ability to harness data for predictive analytics. By collecting and analyzing product, customer and order data, AI can help B2B organizations make more informed decisions around dynamic pricing, demand forecasting and buyer behavior predictions. For example, AI can forecast demand giving businesses the ability to adjust inventory and pricing, update budgets, reduce risk and even identify new opportunities. Additionally, it can analyze buyer behavior to provide insights into which products are likely to perform best in different markets. The result? B2B manufacturers and distributors can become more proactive and strategic in decision-making to secure competitive advantages and ensure long-term success. 2. Enhance the Buyer Experience In B2B ecommerce, providing a seamless and personalized buyer experience is essential for building long-term relationships. AI can enhance customer service through the use of chatbots and virtual assistants powered by large language models (LLMs). These tools provide 24/7 real-time assistance, answering customer queries and guiding purchases. In addition to enhancing customer service, AI delivers tailored product recommendations based on user preferences and behavior, creating a more personalized experience. This level of customization not only increases the chance of repeat business but also strengthens brand loyalty by making the purchasing process more seamless and efficient than ever before. For instance, if a retail or hospitality business partners with a wholesale distributor like Twin Liquors to stock their shelves with the 200 most popular liquor bottles in the U.S., AI can automatically generate a curated order. This saves time and ensures that the buyer gets the necessary products without the hassle of manual searching. 3. Optimize Operations and Sales AI is transforming operational efficiency in B2B ecommerce, particularly in areas like supply chain management and sales optimization. Predictive analytics powered by AI can improve inventory management, ensuring that businesses maintain optimal stock levels while avoiding overstocking or understocking. AI also plays a critical role in streamlining the quote-to-cash process and can offer an AI-integrated quote workflow that automates pricing configurations and speeds up the quoting process, allowing sales reps to focus on closing deals more efficiently. Best Practices for AI Integration Implementing AI in B2B ecommerce requires a thoughtful approach to integration, data management and scalability. To begin, businesses must ensure that AI solutions seamlessly integrate with their existing systems, such as ERP and CRM platforms. Starting with AI tools that align with the company’s current digital infrastructure is essential to avoid unnecessary complexity. Data management is another critical factor in AI implementation. AI’s effectiveness relies heavily on the quality of the data it processes. Businesses must prioritize regular data audits and cleansing practices to ensure the accuracy and integrity of their data. Clean, reliable data enables AI to generate accurate insights and predictions, which in turn drives better decision-making. Finally, B2B brands should choose AI platforms that offer scalability and customization. As the business grows, AI",

Ready to explore how ecommerce automation can restructure your financial plan and boost your business health? Let’s dive in! Understanding AI and automation in ecommerce accounting Running an ecommerce business means drowning in data. With massive volumes of data pouring in from multiple sales channels, one potent way for ecommerce businesses to keep up is by using AI tools to automate the accounting process. What is AI in ecommerce accounting? AI in ecommerce accounting means using smart algorithms to analyze huge amounts of financial data, from sales to inventory, and uncover insights that would be impossible to find manually. Traditional methods struggle to process the large scale of ecommerce data efficiently. This is where AI fuels strategic decision-making. By using AI for ecommerce, you can leverage data-driven insights to automate tasks like order processing, inventory m, etc. This further frees up staff to focus on strategic initiatives. Once you realize the power of AI in ecommerce, it becomes easier to forecast future sales, optimize pricing strategies, predict customer behavior, and automate financial workflows. For example, an AI system might notice that your bestselling product actually yields the smallest profit margin, or that customers who buy a certain combination of products tend to become repeat customers. These insights aren't just interesting. They're actionable intelligence that can shape your strategy. What is accounting automation? Still, juggling matching multiple transactions across platforms or manually entering data from invoices? Accounting automation tackles these tedious tasks. Accounting automation can handle repetitive processes like data entry, invoice processing, and reconciliations, allowing your team to focus on high-value activities. The power couple: AI and automation Using a combination of AI and automation for your ecommerce business brings financial clarity and control, most important to scale your business without any roadblocks. Together, they form a formidable duo that can streamline your entire accounting workflow. Automation handles the routine tasks, while AI analyzes the data and surfaces actionable insights. When AI and automation work together, you'll see benefits that go way beyond just saving time: Identify and eliminate costly mistakes before they happen (like duplicate payments or pricing errors) to save money and improve customer satisfaction Make inventory decisions based on data rather than gut feeling to forecast demand and optimize inventory levels Have accurate cash flow projections to predict future financial needs and manage potential shortages Make tax preparation a breeze by having all your financial data organized and ready for your accountant Also read: The Complete Guide to Ecommerce Accounting in 2026 Key benefits of AI and automation in ecommerce accounting According to a 2023 survey, one in four B2B organizations fully included AI-based technologies in their e-commerce operations in the United States.

We explore the current landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) within pricing strategies, as well as the technology’s overarching advantages in regard to pricing. We aim to understand the principal obstacles encountered when harnessing AI within pricing strategies and propose strategies for retailers looking to mitigate these challenges. Our analysis is informed by a recent Coresight Research survey of 150 retail business decision-makers in the US, conducted by Coresight Research on February 1–2, 2024. Market Scale and Opportunity The global retail pricing optimization software market is poised for significant growth, reflecting the retail sector’s increased reliance on technology for product pricing amid economic volatility. Coresight Research estimates that the market will total $1.6 billion in 2024 and grow at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 16.5% between 2023 and 2028. The US holds the largest market share, at 51.0% (as of 2023), and is set to grow at a significant 14.8% CAGR between 2023 and 2028, with its market share totaling $1.4 billion. Coresight Research Analysis Optimal Pricing Strategies Contribute to Success The global retail pricing optimization software market is poised for significant growth, reflecting the retail sector’s increased reliance on technology for product pricing amid economic volatility. Coresight Research estimates that the market will total $1.6 billion in 2024 and grow at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 16.5% between 2023 and 2028. The US holds the largest market share, at 51.0% (as of 2023), and is set to grow at a significant 14.8% CAGR between 2023 and 2028, with its market share totaling $1.4 billion. AI-Informed Pricing Decisions Are Prevalent Among Retailers Our survey found that an overwhelming majority — 92% of respondents — stated that they use an AI-based pricing solution to inform their pricing decisions. We then asked those who are currently using an AI-based pricing solution whether they have benefited from that AI-based pricing solution and found that all respondents have benefited at least “slightly.” Leveraging AI Can Be Cumbersome and Challenging While AI is prevalently used in pricing strategies and its benefits are well-known, the level of sophistication and integration varies across organizations. It can be challenging for companies to leverage an advanced AI-based pricing solution primarily due to the inputs that the algorithm requires to produce robust results. The three most widely cited challenges in leveraging AI for pricing are: a lack of integration with key complementary business functions (e.g., promotion planning); a lack of trust around AI models; and limited integration capabilities with company-wide solutions. Integrated Business Functions and Real-Time Pricing Amplify AI-Based Pricing Benefits The current state of pricing strategies and the level of integration between pricing and complementary business functions underline the underutilization of technology and a lack of sophisticated tech use. Our survey revealed that, on average, only 41% of respondents stated they have “fully integrated” their price planning strategies with the five complementary business functions we surveyed about. Examining the data by company size reveals that the opportunity is even more pressing for retailers earning less than $1 billion in total sales — only 37% of respondents from this group, on average, cited full integration across key business functions. We asked those respondents currently leveraging an AI-based pricing solution about the method they are using to inform pricing decisions and found real-time pricing has huge growth potential, with only 56% of respondents currently using real-time pricing. Outlook on AI Usage and Investments Reveals Upbeat Retailer Sentiment We asked those currently leveraging AI-based pricing solutions whether they plan to increase investments in AI-based pricing solutions in the coming 12 months: 97% of respondents stated that they plan to increase those investments in the coming year. We then asked respondents about which differentiators would cause them to pick one AI-based pricing solution over another. Our results found that the most influential differentiators were those that supported retailers’ integration goals — especially integration with key complementary business functions and with company-wide solutions. What We Think An effective pricing strategy can often be a leading driver of profits and provide an edge over the competition. Currently, there is prevalent use of AI-based pricing software in the US market and various major retailers, including Best Buy, Kroger and Macy’s, have recently highlig",

Artificial Intelligence (AI) helps drive these experiences to ensure a consistent and unified engagement for every journey the consumer chooses to take. As people change their behaviours, retailers, marketers, salespeople and customer support reps will need to react fast, as they are likely to have multiple touchpoints with a retailer & expect their journey between each touchpoint or channel should be seamless. This means retailers will need to pursue one holistic approach – an omnichannel experience that consumers can willingly use anytime & anywhere, driven by AI. Major factors such as customer sentiment and brand image help drive customer retention in today’s market. By understanding customer sentiment alongside delivering a consistent brand image, retailers will see an improvement in customer retention and consumer relationship. From providing a seamless omnichannel experience to better personalisation, artificial intelligence opens up a lot of new possibilities. By tapping into the power of data far faster and more efficiently than humans ever could, AI can improve the overall customer experience. More resources: AI Myths Debunked How AI Helps Retailers Boost Customer Retention Artificial Intelligence is a key cornerstone of many retail customer retention strategies, by allowing brands to interact with their customers and nurture the relationship in an organic and personalised way. This is key to building strong customer loyalty and promote retention, while also effectively engaging with an audience to drive revenue creation opportunities. In this article, we will examine five ways that AI can help you improve your customer loyalty. 1) Predictive Analytics Keeps Stock Levels Relevant Before diving into this point, a quick definition of what predictive analytics is: Predictive analytics describe the use of statistics and modelling to determine future performance based on current and historical data. Predictive analytics look at patterns in data to determine if those patterns are likely to emerge again, which allows businesses and investors to adjust where they use their resources to take advantage of possible future events. Customer engagement, specifically how your customers view and interact with your brand, is a key factor in your marketing efforts. Organisations that have a 360-degree view of their customers and their needs at the core of their marketing strategy at set to be successful. Big data has changed the way marketing and sales teams engage with customers. It has changed the way that businesses market to their customers, which in turn, helps companies increase their profits. From our own research and case studies at Data Clarity, companies using personalised marketing and campaign optimisation increase sales around 40% – read more about that here. AI and big data analytics provides the business intelligence you need to bring about positive change, like improving existing products or increasing revenue per customer by generating insights into customer behaviour and predict what customers are looking for with accuracy. Product and merchandising teams can use these powerful insights to accurately predict sales in particular the colours, styles, fit and sizing that their customer base actually wants to purchase. Production teams need to know the right quantities of fabric to order to reduce stock waste. Case Study Sephora uses predictive analysis for their email marketing campaigns. With this innovation, they are able to easily keep track of their customers’ purchase histories and then, based on the date of purchase, they calculate how long it will take for the product to run out. When the product is about to run out, they send their customers emails with relevant offers for the product. In addition, they feature complementary products in their emails, which is a great way to ensure that customers remain happy with and loyal to the brand.

Consumer expectations, and the desire to shop in various ‘channel-hopping’ ways, means that being able to deliver seamless experiences across each touch point across every channel is the only way to win consistent customer loyalty. To develop a successful personalisation strategy, the key is to understand your customers’ preferences. Manually running through each user’s history is too labour-intensive for any organisation, AI can help you discover exactly what your customers like quickly a",

    "extractedText": "There’s been a noticeable shift towards manufacturers and retailers relying more and more on technology, like artificial intelligence and machine learning, and data to make their decisions on what to produce and what to sell in both long and short term forecasting. There are also a number of startups that are providing these types of tools to retailers and manufacturers, analyzing this data through the use of AI, such as Stylumia and MakerSights, and now a new survey from multicloud solutions provider Rackspace Technology on Tuesday underlines just how important these technological innovations have become, and will be going forward, to these retailers. The data, which was released exclusively to Chain Store Age, showed 71% of retail respondents saying that AI and ML currently leads their IT/business strategy. That includes 62% who use the technology to predict business performance and 61% who use it for data analysis, while 56% use it as a driver of innovation and 52% use it to improve speed and efficiency, as well as to reduce risk in the future. The survey polled 1,420 global IT decision-makers across industries that included retail, financial services, manufacturing, hospitality, government, and healthcare, in companies and organizations that have between 1,000 to 9,999 employees and an annual revenue between $50 million and $1 billion. Still, these technologies are relatively new for these organizations, as nearly half, 43%, said they only began using AI and ML within the last two years, and 25% within the last year. That might be why there’s still some trepidation when it comes to using artificial intelligence and machine learning: 55% said they encountered pushback or scrutiny about the penetration of AI/ML in their organization. Meanwhile, 30% said there are strongly enough checks and balances in place to avoid the negative consequences of AI/ML, and 47% said they there are only slightly enough checks and balances in place at the moment. Organizations also seem to be split on whether or not they trust the results they get from this technology, as 35% said they slightly trust them, and slightly less, 33%, said they strongly trust them. Despite all of that, they’re still using them, and for a good reason: these companies are already seeing the benefits of using these technologies. That includes 41% of retail respondents who said there have been substantial benefits, and 32% saying they’ve seen modest benefits. Only 23% said it’s too early to tell. Along those benefits were 73% who said faster time to profitability, increased productivity, increased revenue streams, operation cost reduction, and 72% who said it improved customer satisfaction, risk management. Another 69% said it increased innovation, personalized marketing, 66% said the technologies increased understanding of business/customers, 65% said they reduced cost of new product development, and 64% said they enhanced the company’s ability to hire/recruit new talent and increased sales. “As AI and machine learning mature and projects mature, we are seeing it expand out across the organization and become more ubiquitous, advancing in its importance, visibility, and usage,” said Jeff DeVerter, chief technology evangelist, Rackspace Technology, said in a statement. “The fact that more respondents began their AI/ML journey within the past year is striking, and points to the fact that these technologies are seen as they key to driving efficiencies in uncertain economic times. At the same time, the research makes clear that many organizations are still struggling to understand or realize the technologies’ full benefits of AI/ML, and many face internal resistance to adoption.” (Image source: coresight.com) Tags:aiartificial intelligenceretailsurvey Share This Story, Choose Your Platform!

As the features roll out on Nov. 1, Walmart is hoping to connect customers with deals and generally improve search, navigation and wish-list use. Walmart is No. 2 in the Top 2000. The database is Digital Commerce 360’s ranking of North America’s online retailers by their annual ecommerce sales. Digital Commerce 360 projects that Walmart online sales will reach $148.59 billion in 2025. Walmart is also No. 8 in the Global Online Marketplaces. That database ranks the top such marketplaces by third-party gross merchandise value (GMV). Charts & Data Walmart online sales, fulfillment efficiency guide Q3 revenue growth Abbas Haleem | Nov 21, 2025 How Walmart is using AI for the 2025 holiday season Walmart showcased five new AI features in its Oct. 31 announcement. They include: In-Store Savings, a tool to display which items are on sale at local stores. Improved search and navigation, including the ability to see an item’s location within a physical store, with visibility for items on wish lists as well. Party planning advice from Walmart’s AI assistant, Sparky. AI-generated audio summaries for product descriptions and reviews for at least 1,000 beauty products. Generative AI-powered augmented reality to visualize products in three-dimensional contexts,. One form is through Shop the Background, in which shoppers can click on items in product images to add them to carts. The other, called Dynamic Showroom, lets consumers view different spaces and swap out furnishings to match their preferences. “The most wonderful time of the year should be joyful, and with the power of AI and technology, we’re making that possible,” said Tracy Poulliot, senior vice president of shopping experiences at Walmart U.S. “Whether customers are holiday shopping in our stores or from the comfort of home, we’re giving them the tools to check off their lists quicker and easier than ever before.” Poulliot noted that when customers use Walmart’s app while shopping in stores, they spend 25% more “on average than on trips when they don’t use the app.” Growing AI use at Walmart The new AI features follow other launches in 2025 that have seen Walmart increase the scope of generative and agentic AI use across its operations. Sparky, for instance, is just one of Walmart’s four AI “super agents” that it designed to operate in specific areas and manage other, lesser agents within Walmart’s systems. The other three super agents include a Walmart associate agent, as well as Marty, an agent to help Walmart partners, and an agent that helps Walmart’s internal software developers.

Once considered slow to adapt to e-commerce, the retail giant has turned setbacks into strategic wins—emerging as a leader in AI-driven retail innovation. Overcoming E-Commerce Setbacks In the early days, Walmart struggled to keep pace with online competitors. However, strategic acquisitions like Jet.com and Kosmix, combined with pandemic-driven sales growth, helped the company rebound. By 2023, Walmart had become the third most popular e-commerce site in the U.S., solidifying its position in the digital marketplace. Charting an AI Course Today, Walmart isn’t just following industry trends—it’s setting them. The company is leading the retail sector in AI deployment, leveraging advanced technologies to enhance customer experiences, streamline operations, and outpace rivals like Amazon. The Data Advantage One of Walmart’s greatest strengths lies in its tremendous databases, fueled by omnichannel data from both physical stores and online sales. This unique blend of insights gives Walmart a competitive edge over purely online retailers, enabling smarter decisions and personalized shopping experiences. 🤖 Walmart’s AI “Super Agents” Strategy Walmart is moving beyond experimentation into full-scale implementation of agentic AI systems. At the heart of this transformation are four “Super Agents”—AI tools composed of multiple task-focused agents designed to act autonomously across the company: Super Agent Target Audience Function/Goal Sparky Customers (Walmart app) Helps shoppers find items, reorder products, organize events, and streamline the purchase process through conversational commerce. Marty Partners (suppliers, advertisers) Assists with onboarding, order management, and optimizing Walmart Connect advertising campaigns. Associate Agent Walmart Associates Unifies internal workflows like schedules and sales data to save time and improve in-store focus. Developer Agent Developers Speeds up testing, building, and launching new AI and tech tools across the company. These agents represent a bold step toward autonomous workflows, improving efficiency and customer engagement at scale. Strategic Partnerships and Future Growth Walmart’s AI ambitions extend beyond internal operations: OpenAI Partnership: Walmart is integrating shopping capabilities into ChatGPT, aiming to capture referral traffic and gain an edge in generative AI. Operational AI: From inventory forecasting to routing and digital twin technology, AI is critical for optimizing supply chains and maintaining razor-thin margins. Measuring Impact: While Walmart’s AI strategy is still in its early stages, the goal is clear—drive sales and efficiency. Amazon’s competing AI tool, Rufus, is projected to generate $10 billion in incremental annualized sales, setting a high benchmark for Walmart’s efforts. The Road Ahead As highlighted in the article “Walmart Blasts Past Agent Experimentation,” the retailer is moving beyond small-scale tests into full-scale AI implementation. This evolution positions Walmart not just as a retail leader, but as a technology innovator shaping the future of commerce.

This shift will fundamentally transform how brands reach customers, measure impact, and grow with new capabilities that can anticipate, recommend, and act. AI-powered retail media will fuel the next generation of digital media innovation by combining first-party shopping signals, omnichannel scale, and multi-format engagement—advantages Walmart Connect uniquely delivers. We’re building the future of AI-powered retail media—one that is more intelligent, more connected, and more accountable than ever before, powered by our unparalleled omnichannel scale, solutions, and signals. For advertisers, this means campaigns that adapt faster, perform smarter, and prove results with greater certainty. When marketers can spend less time troubleshooting and more time creating, it opens a future where AI and human creativity will work together to spark innovation, spark growth, and spark sales. And it’s already underway. How we’re using AI to make retail media smarter, simpler, and more effective Across the industry, marketers are asking the same question: “How will AI make my advertising better?” Our answer is clear: By removing friction, boosting performance, and connecting brands with customers in more relevant, predictive ways. For example: Connecting to agentic shopping experiences: In fall 2025, we tested our first advertising formats tied to Walmart’s Sparky agent, which we’ll continue this year. AI-first shopping experiences have the potential to transform how customers search and discover products. In fact, 81% of surveyed Walmart customers said they’d used Sparky to check product availability and review product specifications before making a purchase.1 Search remains the most popular entry point, but as customers adopt these new shopping behaviors—as with all new touchpoints—we are exploring ways to help brands continue to meet customers where they are.GenAI-powered performance insights: We’re using GenAI to turn omnichannel retail data into clear, actionable intelligence, such as with our end-of-campaign reports and path to conversion reports—coming to the Walmart Connect Ad Center in FY27.Scaling ad creative: GenAI is beginning to help advertisers of all sizes quickly produce ready-to-activate ad creatives in minutes, such as lifestyle backgrounds for a brand’s products in our Automated Brand Shop Builder. Our Automated Creative Generator can reduce creative production time by 80%.2More strategic support: Our teams are using newer forms of AI to efficiently scale and provide more strategic guidance to brands—from a research assistant that instantly synthesizes documents for faster insights, to automatically generating brand-specific insights newsletters powered by Walmart’s associate super agent. One of our biggest accomplishments this year is the rollout of our new advertising assistant, which will help power Walmart’s Marty super agent, first introduced in July 2025. Meet Marty advertising assistant: Where AI meets real advertiser value Our agentic advertising assistant helps brands of all sizes to run smarter, faster, and more effective campaigns. Users of any level of expertise can build, optimize, and troubleshoot campaigns with ease—like simplifying campaign setup through plain-language guidance, from strategy to execution. Now in beta for Sponsored Search campaigns, our advertising assistant provides clear answers and actionable recommendations via conversational chat—from bidding and keywords to billing—including personalized alerts.

Today, it also captures Walmart’s latest push into artificial intelligence, as the retailer leans into partnerships, while its biggest rival, Amazon, takes a more closed approach. On Sunday, Walmart and Google announced a partnership that brings the retailer’s shopping experience inside Google’s AI assistant, Gemini. Customers will be able to search for products, assemble a basket and check out directly within the chat interface using Google Pay. The partnership, unveiled during a keynote speech at the National Retail Federation’s Big Show industry conference in New York at the Javits Center, will utilize Walmart’s and Sam’s Club’s product selections, pricing and delivery capabilities. The companies said the experience will initially roll out in the U.S., though a launch date was not shared, and then expand internationally. In a separate NRF panel moderated by CNBC’s Jon Fortt, Walmart Executive Vice President and U.S. Chief Technology Officer Hari Vasudev said collaboration was a key part of the company’s approach to AI. “That approach of open partnerships is something that we strongly believe in,” Vasudev said. “What you’re able to do very effectively is serve the customer the best, so we are always going to be very open to partnering.” By partnering with Google, Walmart is building on earlier efforts to prepare for a future in which customers will increasingly use AI chatbots to make purchases. In October, Walmart inked a partnership with Gemini competitor OpenAI to let shoppers buy products directly inside ChatGPT. Walmart has also developed four of its own “super agents,” including the consumer-facing AI chatbot called Sparky, to deepen its AI push, according to the company. Walmart’s propensity to form partnerships with AI and tech companies to scale its AI ambitions sets it apart from its biggest rival, Amazon, which has largely forgone any such deals in favor of investing in its own AI tools. “Walmart seems to be willing to try many of them,” said Juozas Kaziukėnas, an independent e-commerce analyst, referring to the retailer’s work with outside AI companies. “It’s part of OpenAI’s initiative. It’s part of Google. It’s the opposite strategy of Amazon, which, to this day, remains missing from all those partnerships.” The Gemini integration is one of the first major retail implementations of Google’s new Universal Commerce Protocol, or UCP, an open standard designed to let AI agents complete checkout across platforms. Google announced the protocol at NRF alongside more than two dozen partners, including Shopify, Target and Etsy. Amazon was noticeably absent from the list. Industry analysts say the contrast with Amazon has become more pronounced in recent weeks. Amazon has been testing its own agentic features, including “Buy For Me,” which allows customers to purchase items from third-party websites without leaving Amazon’s app. But the rollout has drawn criticism from brands that say their products appeared on Amazon without permission. Against that backdrop, Walmart’s willingness to plug into open standards stands out. Other companies, like e-commerce platform Shopify, are also taking a collaborative approach when it comes to AI. Shopify has partnered with OpenAI, but it also co-developed Google’s UCP. In turn, Shopify merchants will be able to sell their wares within AI Mode in Google and the Gemini app. Shopify has also introduced an “agentic plan” that will let non-Shopify merchants sell through AI channels — including ChatGPT, GoogleAI Mode and Gemini, Copilot and Perplexity — as well as the Shop app and future partners. The plan lets merchants add their product data to the “Shopify Catalog,” a database of all the products sold by stores on Shopify, to appear in AI chat platforms. Prospective merchants can join a waitlist to participate in the program. “While everyone is forming these multi-dozen company partnerships and building integration protocols, Amazon seems to have limited itself to a very basic approach,” according to Juozas Kaziukėnas, an independent e-commerce analyst. For its part, Amazon has focused on building its own AI tools. In addition to “Buy for Me,” the Seattle-based e-commerce company has rolled out features like “Auto Buy,” which automatically purchases items for customers when prices drop. Amazon says shoppers who use its chatbot Rufus are 60% more likely to finish a purchase, and it expects the agent to generate mor",

Here's your briefing on the most important stories from the past few days, including Pacsun, Papa Johns, Google Cloud, JD Sports Fashion, commercetools, Zalando, Amazon, osapiens, and Otto Group.1. Walmart and Google Gemini team on AI discovery and shopping experiences pushWalmart and Google are gearing up to launch a new experience built by Walmart and accessible directly within Gemini using the Universal Commerce Protocol.Gemini will automatically include Walmart and Sam’s Club in-store and online products when it’s relevant. For example, when a customer asks for advice on camping equipment for the spring season, it will return items from the retailer’s inventory of products. And since people talk back and forth with Gemini, there are more opportunities to show relevant products and services throughout the conversation.When customers discover items in Gemini, Walmart helps them move from inspiration to purchase , all within the familiar Walmart and Sam’s environments. When customers link their accounts, the retailer will recommend complementary items based on their past online and in-store purchases, combine their order with other items they’ve put in their carts, and provide all the benefits of their Walmart+ and Sam’s Club memberships.Customers and members can get in-store and club items delivered, with hundreds of thousands of locally curated products delivered in under three hours and as fast as 30 minutes.2. Otto Group boosts supply chain operations via NVIDIA and Reply robotics partnershipOtto Group, a digital retail and services group, is partnering with NVIDIA and Reply as it looks to improve supply chain operations through robotics.The initiative will see a network wide deployment of a Robotic Coordination Layer, powered by NVIDIA Omniverse libraries, and Isaac Sim, across a multitude of Otto Group’s 120 logistics locations. This connects robot fleets in the warehouse to a digital twin which displays the real-time locations and movements of all robots. Developed by Reply, this solution uses reality capture techniques and post-processing from sensors and cameras mounted on Boston Dynamics' Spot robot as it moves through the warehouse. Once established, the digital twin enables virtual reconfiguration of warehouse areas for process optimisation and simulations to support peak management. Concurrently, the Robotic Coordination Layer integrates with robotic fleet management tools and the WMS to coordinate and communicate with various robotic fleets, all visualised and managed within the digital twin. 3. Pacsun claims market first with launch of its social commerce app PS Community HubPacsun reports the launch of its proprietary digital platform, PS Community Hub, pitched as a first to market concept. It says that, unlike traditional retail apps or loyalty programmes, this integrates social connection, creator monetisation, and co-creation opportunities with a focus on youth culture.The announcement was made as part of a discussion at NRF 2026: Retail's Big Show in New York City focused on Gen Alpha and Gen Z research, with Pacsun CEO Brieane Olson and Business of Fashion's Sheena Butler-Young.\"The creation of PS Community Hub demonstrates our purpose driven retail strategy, putting creators and our youth community at the heart of our plan to fuel sustainable growth, cultural relevance, and innovation in retail,\" says Olson. \"Our deep generational listening and Insights from the Pacsun Youth Report have been instrumental in shaping this initiative, ensuring that we address the evolving needs and aspirations of our young consumers and remain at the forefront of technology and social commerce.\"4. Wing and Walmart set to expand drone delivery to 150 new stores across the USAWing and Walmart are expanding their drone delivery service to an additional 150 Walmart stores in the US over the next year, bringing this to more than 40 million Americans. The pair will establish a network of over 270 drone delivery locations by 2027, stretching from Los Angeles to Miami. This builds on operations in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex and Metro Atlanta.New service areas will include metropolitan hubs such as Los Angeles, St. Louis, Cincinnati, and Miami, with others to be announced at a later date. This expands on previously slated expansion markets: Houston, Orlando, Tampa, and Charlotte, which continues later this week when Wing and Walmart start operating in Houston on 15th January.“Drone delivery plays an important role in our ability to deliver what customers want, exactly when they want it. Whether it’s a last minute ingredient for dinner or a late-night essential for a busy family, the strong adoption we’ve seen confirms that this is the future of convenience,” says Greg Cathey, Senior Vice President ",

    "extractedText": "Ecommerce2024-11-27How Walmart is Revolutionizing Ecommerce with Generative AI—and How Your Brand Can TooKimberly BurghardtIt seems that everywhere we look these days, generative artificial intelligence (AI) is the topic on everyone's minds, and the ecommerce industry is no exception. With technology continuing to evolve and scale, it’s no surprise that the use cases are being applied to all sectors. Businesses are beginning to see the impacts that generative AI can have on optimizing their operations and are seizing the opportunity, with Walmart taking point in this new wave of technology adoption.What Is Generative AI? Generative AI, one of the hottest topics in tech, earned recognition as 2023’s \"Word of the Year\" by Collins Dictionary. But what exactly is it? Generative AI refers to advanced technology capable of creating new content—text, images, or even code—by identifying patterns in massive datasets. This technology uses machine learning models to analyze data, learn from it, and produce human-like outputs.From ChatGPT to MidJourney, generative AI tools are already transforming workflows worldwide. According to McKinsey, these applications could generate up to $4.4 trillion annually for the global economy. The message is clear: generative AI is not just a buzzword but a pivotal force shaping the future of industries like ecommerce.Walmart’s Generative AI Strategy The new wave of technological advancement is not only taking over traditional software spaces, but significantly impacting all industry sectors, including ecommerce. Generative AI applications in the retail and consumer goods sector are projected to see a potential rise in annual revenue by $400-$660 billion. With automated key functions like marketing, customer service, sales, inventory, and supply chain management, the implementation of generative AI is quickly gaining traction across all divisions. Embracing Adaptive Retail with Generative AIWalmart is one of the leading retailers embracing generative AI as a core part of its business strategy to step confidently into the new digital era they’ve coined “adaptive retail”. This new strategy focuses on leveraging technology to meet consumers where they readily spend their time - online and engaging across multiple platforms. As part of this strategy, Walmart has shifted its focus to engage the next generation of customers on gaming platforms, partnering with Roblox to reach over 80 million daily users and solidify its presence in trending digital spaces. Walmart has created an online community and virtual shopping experience, “Walmart Discovered”, where users can explore trending items and creators, virtually shop products and create their own departments within Walmart’s digital storefront, using Roblox’s currency, Robux.Wallaby: Walmart’s Proprietary AI ModelComplementing this approach, Walmart has even developed their own large language model (LLM), Wallaby, a retail-specific algorithm to work alongside other LLMs in creating a cohesive, customized retail experience. Trained off of Walmart's proprietary data, the LLM can predict the customer’s needs and tailor their experience aligning with customer behaviors, all while maintaining Walmart’s branded tone and voice. AI-Powered Customer SupportOne example of Walmart’s AI advancements is their new AI-powered customer support chatbot. The generative AI tool empowers customers in their support journey. The new chatbot is designed to not only guide consumers through their customer experience, but take action as well, such as order cancellations or processing refunds. The company designed the chatbot to give customers autonomy when seeking swift support. As Walmart’s CTO & CDO, Suresh Kumar states “A standard search bar is no longer the fastest path to purchase, rather we must use technology to adapt to customers’ individual preferences and needs”. Walmart’s commitment to adaptation has been proven to pay off, with personalized experiences shown to increase customer engagement and satisfaction by 20% and reducing marketing and sales costs by 10-20%, positively impacting the company’s bottom line.Creating a Personalized Shopping ExperienceWalmart is a leader in offering a personalized shopping experience. By leveraging generative AI, the company is customizing online homepages for each customer, showcasing products and content most relevant to them. This tailored approach mimics an in-store shopping experience, making the online platform feel like their own personalized Walmart. Through generative AI, Walmart is anticipating the types of content customers want to see, further personalizing their experience, and fostering a deeper understanding of their preferences to enhance their shopping journey. ‍‍Streamlining Internal Processes with AI ToolsBeyond the customer experience, Walmart is leveraging AI to optimize internal operations for both in-store associates and corporate employees. Tools like “Ask Sam”, a voice-enabled assistant, helps retail",

    "extractedText": "An article from Walmart: This year, AI tinkering ‘becomes transformation’ A year from now, customers will look back and realize just how much has changed about the shopping experience, Walmart’s Daniel Danker predicts. Published Jan. 15, 2026 Cara Salpini Senior Editor Share Copy link Email LinkedIn X/Twitter Facebook Print License Add us on Google Walmart's Sparky AI agent is already fielding customer service questions and encouraging shoppers to place a regular order. Courtesy of Walmart Listen to the article 5 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback. ORLANDO, Fla. — Walmart hasn’t been shy about its AI ambitions. The retail giant announced an AI framework centered around four super agents over the summer, enabled purchases within ChatGPT this fall and over the weekend announced a new partnership with Google’s Gemini. If it sounds like Walmart is moving fast, that’s intentional. “For the last year or two, we’ve been tinkering with it,” Daniel Danker, executive vice president of AI acceleration, product and design at Walmart, said at the ICR Conference on Tuesday. “This is the year where tinkering becomes transformation. This is the year where we’ve built a level of mastery around that and we’ll start building things that deeply address customer problems.” Danker has many examples of how AI could improve the Walmart shopping experience. For one thing, he sees repeat grocery purchases transitioning to a more automated model, with AI understanding how frequently to replenish items. For another, he envisions customers scrolling through AI-generated photos of themselves wearing the clothes they’re considering buying, or asking AI for recommendations based on what’s already in their closet. “I think of us all as carpenters, and we’ve all been using screwdrivers and suddenly someone shows up with a drill,” Danker said. “There are things you couldn’t build without power tools that you can with power tools. AI is a power tool for us.” Danker also envisions shoppers doing a lot less scrolling across the board, thanks to the new level of personalization AI offers. That shift includes Walmart learning which products a customer wants to splurge on and which they prefer value offerings for; it includes narrowing a shopper’s search results to a specific product that might best fit their needs and suggesting others that complement their purchases. “By the time you have the tomato paste and the ground beef and mozzarella, we're pretty sure you're making lasagna — and we don't need you to search eight times and scroll through many, many pages just to add the basil and the tomato sauce and the ricotta,” Danker said. “Those experiences are going to become more human, more connected. They'll understand your intent, and they'll serve it up to you much more easily.” Walmart’s customer AI agent, Sparky, can already recognize if a specific shopper buys the same items every week and suggest a new order to that customer when they enter the app. It can field customer service questions and answer questions like, “What do I use to get this wine stain out of my carpet?” It can remind shoppers that they have an appointment at Walmart’s auto care center and also a prescription to pick up. Long-term, Danker believes that the Sparky chat interface and Walmart’s traditional search bar will collapse into one search system. But for now, the two exist separately. “It's not going to happen overnight. It's also not going to happen all at once, but I do think this is a year where we will be delivering transformative experiences in commerce,” Danker said. “So you will definitely look back a year from now and say ‘Gosh, that's quite different than how I used to use Walmart. That's quite different than the expectations I used to bring when I opened an app.’” What Danker is most excited about is the potential for Walmart to enter the chat as shoppers ask services like Chat GPT and Gemini questions that aren’t directly related to shopping. Customers who are unsure of their needs may ask these services about what type of TV would fit in their space, how to get that wine stain out or how to handle a new challenge that’s emerged with their newborn baby. Those, Danker argues, are questions that may not start with the intent to purchase, but could end up that way if Walmart is showing up in those spaces. The big-box retailer’s integration with Gemini allows users to benefit from their membership perks with Walmart even if they order through the AI platform and it can also add items ordered with Gemini to a customer’s live Walmart shopping cart online, so they don’t have to place orders from multiple locations. Of course, Walmart doesn’t have direct control over whether its product offerings show up in a Chat GPT or Gemini search, but Danker sees the big-box retailer as well-positioned for the algorithms. Specifically, Walmart’s focus on price and speed will give it a leg up if AI agents are making selections for shoppers, ",

Close 21 November 2025 Retailers insert AI into the customer experience Personalisation Generative AI Customer experience Walmart and Target are deploying AI to enhance consumer-facing experiences, experimenting with the likes of conversational curation and predictive ordering. What’s happening at Target Target is partnering with leading AI platforms to enable the retailer to “curat[e] the shopping experience directly from guests’ own conversation,” COO Michael Fiddelke told an earnings call. Ahead of the holiday season, a GenAI-powered gift finder will help shoppers find the right present. “Guests tell us what they want or even what they’re trying to solve for, and OpenAI will offer personalized recommendations,” he explained. (Examples: “I have a 5-year-old son that loves dinosaurs? What gifts are available for under $20?” or “What is a good present for my mother-in-law?”) Target is also using synthetic audiences, created by AI-driven models, to enable marketing and design teams to test, learn, and refine products, promotions, and messaging before they’re launched. What’s happening at Walmart Walmart, too, has partnered with OpenAI to enable customers and members to purchase items directly from Walmart and Sam’s Club through ChatGPT. “This starts relatively simplistically with the checkout process,” CEO Doug McMillon told an earnings call. “It will become more immersive, [with] integrated and seamlessly connected experiences that bring Walmart closer to customers in new ways.” Walmart’s digital agent Sparky is being developed to take more action on behalf of customers, such as helping people think about reordering things they may want or giving “nudges about staying in stock”. In Chile, Walmart is taking this a stage further, trialling a capability (Carrito Listo) that uses customer transactional data to create predicted shopping baskets, based on the brands they normally buy at the intervals they prefer; these can then be accepted or modified. Why AI personalization matters Dispensing advice on cheap toy dinosaurs won’t recoup the billions of dollars currently being thrown at AI, but it does normalize the technology in consumers’ everyday lives. And here retailers may have an important role to play in finding a balance between what consumers want and don’t want from AI. Walmart, for example, is using AI to build a multimodal e-commerce experience that is more personalized and relevant, that understands customer intent and anticipates their needs to save them time. And for brands, “Ads will still be present,” said McMillon, “but in a more contextual and helpful way, surfacing as recommendations or sponsored bundles that add value.” Sourced from Seeking Alpha [Image: Getty] Email this content × Send colleagues a link to this content.

The Deloitte Global Retail Outlook 2024 highlights how these pressures are reshaping the retail landscape. It urges leaders to rethink their strategies to maintain profitability while continuing to meet consumer demands.AI-powered business intelligence (BI) is a helpful tool for overcoming retail challenges. It can optimize operations, improve pricing strategies, and increase efficiency in a business. This article explores how AI-powered BI can help retailers:Manage inflationary pressuresReduce operational costsMaintain competitive margins in a challenging economic climateUnderstanding the economic landscape: Insights from Deloitte's Global Retail Outlook 2024The Deloitte Global Retail Outlook 2024 report clearly shows the economic problems retail leaders are currently facing. Inflation and rising costs are major issues for retailers, impacting supply chains, labor expenses, and how they set prices.As the report indicates, retailers are under increasing pressure to find innovative solutions. They also want answers that control costs effectively without sacrificing the quality of the customer experience.According to Deloitte, the retail sector is experiencing a period of \"cost consciousness.\" This means that controlling the cost of goods and services has become as critical as driving revenue. Retailers who don't change their business operations may lose money and customers and face financial problems in the future. However, those that leverage advanced technologies like AI-powered BI are better positioned to navigate these challenges effectively.The role of AI-powered business intelligence in managing inflation1. Optimizing pricing strategiesOne of the most immediate ways that inflation affects retailers is through pricing. As the cost of goods rises, so does the need to adjust prices accordingly. To avoid pushing away price-weary customers, businesses must carefully manage price increases and methods of data collection. AI tools can help stores improve pricing by analyzing data to balance profit and competitiveness.AI can process historical sales data, competitor pricing, market demand, and customer behavior to recommend optimal pricing points. For instance, merchandisers might offer targeted discounts to loyal customers. They could also attract new customers with introductory prices to encourage repeat purchases.This ensures that prices remain competitive while maximizing revenue.Moreover, AI-powered analytics can segment customers based on their price sensitivity, allowing retailers to personalize pricing and promotions. For instance, retailers might offer loyal customers targeted discounts. They could also attract new customers with introductory prices to encourage repeat purchases. By using AI to inform pricing strategies, retailers can mitigate the impact of inflation without compromising on customer satisfaction.2. Reducing operational costsOperational efficiency is another critical area where AI-powered BI can make a significant impact. The Deloitte report highlights the importance of streamlining operations to combat rising costs. AI can help retailers identify inefficiencies across their operations, from supply chain management to workforce allocation. Supply Chain Optimization: AI-powered BI tools can analyze supply chain data and the acquisition of raw materials. They can:Identify bottlenecksForecast demand more accuratelyOptimize inventory levelsThis reduces the risk of overstocking or stockouts, both costly. By improving supply chain efficiency, retailers can lower the cost of goods sold and reduce waste. This directly contributes to better margins.For example, predictive analytics can forecast demand by analyzing the following:Historical sales dataMarket trendsExternal factors, like weather patterns or economic shiftsThis allows retailers to adjust their inventory levels proactively, reducing the costs associated with excess inventory or emergency replenishment.Workforce management: Labor costs are another significant concern for retailers, particularly in an environment where wages are rising. AI-powered BI can help optimize workforce management.It does this by predicting peak times and ensuring that staffing levels match customer demand. This not only reduces labor costs. It also improves customer service by ensuring that the right number of employees are available when needed.For instance, AI can analyze foot traffic patterns in stores to predict busy periods and recommend optimal staffing schedules. This ensures that retailers have the right amount of staff during peak hours. This reduces the need for costly overtime or temporary workers while maintaining service quality.3.

During these unstable economic times, companies must understand the impact of inflation on business and actively seek innovative solutions to soften it. AI technology proves to be a beacon of hope, offering a way to weather the storm and come out on the other side even stronger. With these challenges and opportunities in mind, this article will explore how AI can help manage the impact of inflation on businesses. The Impact of Inflation on Business In simple terms, inflation represents the rate the general level of prices for goods and services grows, which erodes purchasing power over time. The long-term average inflation rate in the United States is 3.28%. As of April 10, 2024, the current rate was 3.48%. Although higher than the average, this number is down from 4.98% in 2023. That being said, inflation still proves to be a significant concern for businesses, as it can have a domino effect on various aspects of operations. These include: Increased operational costs: The rise in prices affects raw materials, utilities, and labor costs. Reduced consumer purchasing power: With their money not stretching as far, consumer demand for products and services can dwindle. Supply chain challenges: Fluctuating costs and availability lead to inventory management headaches. Strategic pricing adjustments: Businesses must delicately balance profit margins with market conditions to stay competitive. Forecasting difficulty: Market uncertainty makes it tougher to predict future demand and make informed decisions. The AI Response to Inflation Considering these challenges, a proactive and data-driven approach is clearly needed. Here’s how AI fits into the picture. Predictive Analytics Through sophisticated machine learning and deep learning algorithms, predictive analytics let businesses: Analyze vast volumes of data Extract valuable insights Identify emerging trends Backed by historical data and real-time information, predictive analytics provides foresight into future market movements. Businesses can then anticipate changes, such as fluctuations in material costs or shifts in consumer spending patterns. Armed with this predictive capability, businesses can make informed and strategic decisions thanks to being able to adjust their strategies in response to inflation proactively. Dynamic Pricing AI-driven dynamic pricing strategies revolutionize how businesses respond to inflationary pressures, competition, and evolving consumer demands. With advanced algorithms, businesses can dynamically adjust prices in real-time based on factors like changes in production costs, market demand, and competitor pricing. Agile pricing allows businesses to maintain a delicate balance between profitability and customer satisfaction. Prices remain competitive while maximizing revenue opportunities. Dynamic pricing is a powerful tool businesses can rely on to navigate the complexities of inflation. It allows them to evolve to market dynamics and optimize pricing strategies to mitigate its adverse effects. Supply Chain Optimization Thanks to vast datasets and predictive modeling techniques, AI-powered supply chain optimization solutions offer businesses unparalleled foresight and efficiency in managing logistics and inventory. AI systems help accurately predict potential disruptions in the supply chain, ranging from raw material shortages to transportation delays. AI algorithms also optimize routes, warehouse management, and inventory levels. This improves the efficient allocation of resources and minimizes operational costs. This proactive approach to supply chain management serves as a defense against the upheaval often triggered by inflation. As such, it allows businesses to maintain continuity in their operations and meet customer demands with greater agility and resilience. Enhanced Risk Management AI-powered risk management systems analyze market volatility and economic indicators to identify potential risks associated with inflation. For example, they can point out currency fluctuations or interest rate changes. This proactive identification process and mitigation of these risks helps businesses protect their financial stability and minimize losses. Customer Segmentation and Targeting AI algorithms can analyze consumer behavior data to segment customers based on their sensitivity to price changes and purchasing power amid inflation. Then, businesses can tailor marketing strategies and product offerings to different customer segments. This boosts their maximum effectiveness and customer retention even in the face of economic challenges. Automated Cost Optimization AI-driven systems can automate cost optimization processes by continuously monitoring expenses across various aspects of operations, such as procurement, production, and distribution.

In the past, central banks tended to assume these shocks were temporary and outside the reach of interest rate tools. Biagio Bossone writes that this is no longer the case. Central banks must rethink passive “look-through” strategies and build AI-aware frameworks to respond swiftly. Artificial intelligence is often celebrated for its potential to boost productivity. But AI may also bring a new kind of economic disruption: AI-propagated supply shocks. These shocks arise not only from technology itself but also because algorithms spread disruptions through pricing, labour markets and expectations in real time. This poses a challenge for monetary policy. For decades, central banks have often “looked through” supply shocks, assuming they are temporary and outside the reach of interest rate tools. But that doctrine is becoming harder to defend. As Bank of England’s Megan Greene recently argued, supply shocks today are not always short-lived. Firms tend to adjust prices more frequently when inflation is already high, amplifying the initial impact. Expectations also behave in nonlinear ways: once inflation crosses certain thresholds, households and businesses respond disproportionately. In such an environment, the neat separation between supply and demand disturbances breaks down. Sometimes the optimal policy is to act, not to wait. The latest research shows why this matters. If central banks treat a cost shock as temporary but it turns out to be persistent, holding rates steady can add fuel to inflation. By keeping real interest rates too low, policy inadvertently stimulates demand at the wrong time. In many models, simple rule-based responses or earlier action tend to outperform passive “look-through” strategies. Sign up here for our weekly newsletter Shock generator and amplifier AI makes these risks more pressing by altering both the origin and diffusion of shocks. Algorithmic pricing and markups. Firms now use AI systems to monitor demand, input costs, and competitors continuously. Prices can be adjusted automatically and in unison. This reduces the natural “stickiness” that once slowed the spread of shocks. A rise in energy costs in one sector can quickly lead to synchronized price hikes across many others, turning a relative price change into broad inflation pressure. Labor market disruptions. AI adoption often displaces workers, particularly in routine jobs. Re-entry into employment requires retraining, which takes time. During this adjustment, effective labor supply is constrained, pushing up unit labor costs and inflation. Over the longer run, AI boosts productivity, lowers costs, and raises potential output. But the transition is uneven, with inflationary effects up front and disinflationary gains later. Machine-mediated expectations. Expectations are no longer formed only by humans. Algorithms parse data and feed directly into pricing engines, investment bots, and consumption models. When inflation crosses certain thresholds, these systems can trigger rapid and synchronized repricing. Central bank communication loses traction in this world: algorithms respond to data consistency, not verbal assurances. Figure 1 maps the channels through which AI can amplify supply shocks — from synchronised pricing to labour disruptions and machine-mediated expectations. Figure 1. Channels of AI-propagated supply shocks Figure 2 illustrates how these dynamics play out over time: inflationary at first, persistent during transition, and ultimately disinflationary as productivity gains materialise. Figure 2. AI-driven supply shocks: from disruption to disinflation Notes: Phase 1 – Disruption and rapid repricing (inflationary); Phase 2 – Transition and bottlenecks (persistence risk); Phase 3 – Productivity gains (disinflationary). “Look-through” is riskier under AI Traditionally, central banks had time to assess whether a supply shock was temporary or persistent. Under AI-propagated supply shocks, that window narrows. Prices adjust faster, contagion spreads wider, and persistence is harder to judge. A passive stance is therefore riskier. The danger of misclassifying shocks is higher, and the cost of delay is steeper. AI-aware policy playbook What should central banks do? Five priorities stand out: Monitor algorithmic dynamics Monetary policy rules should incorporate high-frequency indicators of price changes, sectoral synchrony and online markups. These can serve as early warning signals of AI-driven inflationary bursts. Anchor credibility in data As algorithms parse numbers, not wo",

    "extractedText": "The tide turned against inflation. Artificial intelligence went mainstream — for good or ill. Labor unions capitalized on their growing might to win more generous pay and benefits. Elon Musk renamed and rebranded the social media platform Twitter, removed guardrails against phony or obscene posts and ranted profanely when advertisers fled in droves. The American housing market, straining under the weight of heavy mortgage rates, took a wallop. And Taylor Swift’s concert tour scaled such stratospheric heights that she invigorated some regional economies and drew a mention in Federal Reserve proceedings. A look back at 10 top business stories in 2023: RAGING AGAINST INFLATION The Fed and most other major central banks spent most of the year deploying their interest-rate weapons against the worst bout of inflation in four decades. The trouble had erupted in 2021 and 2022 as the global economy roared out of the pandemic recession, triggering supply shortages and igniting prices. By the end of 2023, though, the Fed, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England had taken a breather. Their aggressive rate hikes had brought inflation way down from the peaks of 2022, when Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent energy and grain prices rocketing and intensified price spikes. In the United States, the Fed’s policymakers delighted Wall Street investors by signaling in December that 2024 would likely be a year of rate cuts — three to be exact, in their expectations — and not rate hikes. The Bank of England and ECB sounded a more cautious note, suggesting that inflation, though trending down, remained above their target. “Should we lower our guard?” Christine Lagarde, the ECB president, told reporters. “We ask ourselves that question. No, we should absolutely not lower our guard.” The Council on Foreign Relations, which tracks interest rates in 54 countries, found that central banks turned aggressive toward inflation in the spring of 2022. Policies remain tight, the council found, but the overall anti-inflation stance has eased. AI GOES MAINSTREAM Artificial intelligence thrust itself into public consciousness this year. But the technology, while dazzling for its ability to retrieve information or produce readable prose, has yet to match people’s science fiction fantasies of human-like machines. Catalyzing a year of AI fanfare was ChatGPT. The chatbot gave the world a glimpse of advances in computer science, even if not everyone learned quite how it works or how to make the best use of it. Worries escalated as this new cohort of generative AI tools threatened the livelihoods of people who write, draw, strum or code for a living. AI’s ability to produce original content helped fuel strikes by Hollywood writers and actors and legal challenges from bestselling authors. By year’s end, the AI crises had shifted to ChatGPT’s own maker, OpenAI, which was nearly destroyed by corporate turmoil over its CEO, and to a meeting room in Belgium, where European Union leaders emerged after days of talks with a deal for the world’s first major AI legal safeguards. WORKERS SCORE GAINS The long-battered American labor movement flexed its muscle in 2023, taking advantage of widespread worker shortages to demand — and receive — significantly better pay and benefits. From Hollywood writers and actors to autoworkers to hotel workers, 510,000 laborers staged 393 strikes in the first 11 months of 2023, according to Cornell University’s Labor Action Tracker. Under its pugnacious new president, Shawn Fain, the United Auto Workers struck the Big Three automakers — Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent of Chrysler, Jeep and Ram — and won pay raises, improved benefits and numerous other concessions. Hollywood writers and actors, as a result of their walkouts, secured higher pay and protection from the unrestricted use of artificial intelligence, among other concessions. The unions’ gains marked a resurgence for their workers after years following the Great Recession of 2007-2009 when union power further dwindled, wage gains languished and employers seemed to have their pick of job candidates. An explosive economic rebound from the COVID-19 recession of 2020 and a wave of retirements left companies scrambling to find workers and provided labor unions with renewed leverage Still, even now, unions remain a shadow of what they once were: As of last year, roughly 10% of U.S. employees belonged to labor unions, way down from 20% in 1983. And back in the 1970s, the United States experienced an average of 500 strikes a year, involving 2 million workers, said Johnnie Kallas, a labor expert at Cornell. MUSK’S X-RATED TRANSFORMATION A little more than a year ago, Elon Musk walked into Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters, fired its CEO and other top executives and began transforming the social media platform into what’s now known as X. Since then, the company has been bombarded by allegations of misinformation, endured significant advertising losses an",

Source: Khanh Ha, “SMPL model introduction” (2020). LinkAgentic e-commerce is set to change retail at its core. Amazon recently introduced “Buy for Me,” a shopping agent that can search, compare, and complete purchases across Amazon and third-party sites. OpenAI has integrated agentic shopping into ChatGPT, allowing users to buy directly from partners like Etsy and soon Shopify, positioning its assistant as both a conversational tool and a transactional one. Together, these moves show that both companies view autonomous shopping agents as a central part of the future of e-commerce.With SMPL-powered agents, shopping moves from a passive search and click process to an autonomous goal driven process where technology acts on behalf of the consumer. Instead of navigating product pages or managing multiple checkouts, customers define intent and the agent handles the rest, searching, comparing, deciding, and completing transactions across platforms. These agents can reduce one of retail’s biggest problems, product returns. By analyzing body measurements, past purchases, sizing charts, and brand specific fit data, SMPL agents help shoppers find the correct fit before buying, making returns less likely. The outcome is lower costs for retailers, who spend billions annually on reverse logistics and lost resale value, and reduced environmental harm, with millions of tons of CO₂ emissions and waste generated each year from returned goods. This represents a significant transformation of retail into an efficient and sustainable system where commerce is personalized and proactive.So, what is SMPL?SMPL, short for Skinned Multi-Person Linear model, is a parametric 3D human body model that has become the standard for representing digital humans in computer vision. Instead of storing thousands of separate body scans, SMPL compresses human variation into two sets of parameters: shape, which defines body proportions such as height, weight, or muscularity, and pose, which defines how joints move and rotate in 3D space. With these inputs, SMPL generates a mesh of the body that deforms naturally using a technique called linear blend skinning, the same method used in video games and animation to make characters move smoothly. The model was trained on thousands of high-resolution body scans, so it captures both detailed shape variation and natural movement. This makes SMPL useful for applications in film, AR and VR avatars, motion capture, fitness, sports analysis, and fashion technology. Extensions such as SMPL X expand the model to include detailed hand poses and facial expressions, while variants such as STAR allow faster real-time performance. SMPL functions as a digital template of the human body that can be scaled, posed, and adapted for research, design, or commerce.SMPL model with joint regression, where each joint position is estimated as a weighted combination of surrounding vertices. Source: Khanh Ha, “SMPL model introduction” (2020). LinkHow does it work?SMPL works by combining statistics, geometry, and animation into a single model of the human body. At its foundation, it represents a person as a 3D mesh, a set of points connected into triangles that can be reshaped and posed. To capture the diversity of human bodies, SMPL uses shape parameters (β), a small set of numbers that adjust features such as height, weight, muscle tone, and proportions. These parameters were learned by analyzing thousands of 3D scans and compressing them into a compact representation of human variation. Once the body shape is defined, pose parameters (θ) control the rotation of each joint in the skeleton. This allows the mesh to be animated in different positions, with 72 values covering the major joints of the body. To make these movements smooth, SMPL applies Linear Blend Skinning, a technique where each point on the mesh is influenced by nearby joints, ensuring realistic bending and stretching instead of distortions. SMPL also includes blend shapes, which are learned deformations that model the natural effects of motion on muscles and skin, such as shoulders moving when arms are raised. These elements together transform a set of parameters into a 3D human body that can be customized for different uses.SMPL is a model that requires input from real-world data. Sensing and capture technologies provide this input. LiDAR, photogrammetry, and computer vision each offer methods for collecting information about the human body, which can then be translated into SMPL’s shape and pose parameters. Depending on the application, one method may be more suitable than another. LiDAR provides centimeter-level accuracy for medica",

    "extractedText": "Merchants attending PLS in Amsterdam see AI-driven shopping as a long-term game changerThere were several lively discussions with merchants at Payment Leaders’ Summit (PLS) in Amsterdam which illuminated the sector’s latest challenges and opportunities with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and agentic commerce. The event brought together key stakeholders from retail, hospitality, and e-commerce, and opened with candid exchanges around the evolving payment preferences of consumers, growing demand for secure omnichannel solutions, and merchants’ strategies for navigating regulatory changes. These are the customary topics of many of the PLS events. However, this year, there was a consensus reached on the urgent need for closer collaboration between solution providers and merchants to drive seamless, customer-centric innovation in the rapidly changing AI landscape.It was described during the many merchant roundtables that AI in retailing refers to the use of artificial intelligence technologies, such as machine learning and automation, to optimize retail operations, payment optimisation, enhancing personalised customer experiences, and improving decision-making based on data and predictive analytics in fraud prevention. Speaking with merchants, it was discovered that some of them are already receiving requests from AI agents. Around 30% of merchants expect to receive traffic from AI agents within the next six months and 60% of merchants expect to receive traffic from AI agents within the next 12 months. Admittedly, this was not a robust or scientific survey, nevertheless it was based on conversations with over 20 merchant attendees from a wide selection of sectors – including, OTAs, airlines, hotels, and fashion and general merchandise retailers. Security vs. AI fraudWhen consumers use autonomous digital assistants, or AI agents, to search for products, compare offers, and make purchases on their behalf, it requires the merchant’s storefront, product data, APIs, and checkout flows to be optimised for AI agent-driven transactions. An important question was raised – what about strong customer authentication (SCA)? In agentic commerce, SCA is expected to be managed through a combination of tokenization, unique agent-customer interaction, and adaptive security protocols. Many of the merchants at the PLS didn’t know how AI agents use secure payment tokens or were simply unprepared for AI agents. Network tokens, generated and maintained by the international card schemes, link a specific agent to a customer, ensuring every transaction is both authenticated and authorized, with methods such as biometrics, passkeys, or one-time passwords adding further validation before purchase. It was acknowledged that fraudsters exploiting AI agents to use real customers’ payment methods or Alternative Payment Methods outside the card scheme’s secure ecosystem pose a serious threat. What is the solution? No merchant at the PLS had a solution, only the expectation that AI agents will allow another route for the fraudsters to gain access and their fraud prevention measures need to be prepared.Within Edgar, Dunn & Company’s Retail & Hospitality Practice it is expected that AI Agents may have to be registered and verified, using processes like “Know Your Customer” (KYC) for businesses – it will be effectively a KYA protocol - “Know Your Agent”. This will ensure only legitimate, traceable parties are permitted to transact. Any AI agent acting on behalf of a consumer must be authenticated and tied to a specific customer, making unauthorised agent behaviour easier to spot and block. The card scheme networks and Alternative Payment Methods are increasingly using tokenization, linking tokens not just to payment credentials but also AI agent identity, device characteristics, and real-time metadata. This makes stolen tokens or payment credentials much harder for fraudsters to use without matching agent and transaction context.Transactions from AI agents will trigger continuous identity verification (e.g., biometrics, passkeys, dynamic risk scoring) and real-time monitoring of agent behaviour, device usage, and spending patterns. Unlike static checks, these dynamic protocols are expected to catch anomalies that reveal fraudulent use even for payments outside the card rails. However, can an AI complete a biometric check? AI-driven systems now perform biometric authentication, such as facial recognition, fingerprint, iris, and voice verification, by analysing biometric data, and confirming user identity for payment authorisation. Consequently, the fraudsters are expected to use the same AI tools to emulate biometric security seen in the payment industry. This was a serious concern amongst the merchants participating in several of the PLS roundtables. Model Context Protocol (MCP) the communication standard for AIMCP (Model Context Protocol) in agentic commerce serves as a standardised integration layer or protocol that enables AI agents to securely int",

Please subscribe, we want to be sure you make it to the next party. Cheers!SubscribeCocktail: The Perfect MartiniI don’t think there is much argument that the Martini is the most iconic of cocktails. Gin - let’s ignore any talk of vodka for now - cut with vermouth in varying proportions stands as the literal symbol cocktailing for better or worse (See: 🍸). Indeed, no mixed drink has inspired so many poems, prose, jokes and iconic images as the Martini. Over close to two centuries, the Martini has graduated from cocktail spec to a signifier of cultural refinement - that is if it is a real one.A Stirred, Not Shaken, HistoryThe origin story of the Martini has been long sought after, much debated, and at times simply imagined. The most repeated origin story is that the Martini was born from the Martinez, a drink with gin and sweet-vermouth supposedly invented for a thirsty California gold-rush era miner on his way to the Sacramento River Delta port town of Martinez with a pocket full of gold nuggets. He supposedly saddled up the bar, dropped a crumb of gold on the mahogany and asked for something like, “Cold gin, cut with vermouth”. The problem is that the source of the Martinez story was an infant at the time… and certainly unlikely to have been imbibing next to a grizzled 49er at the bar. (A dream… What would Carl Jung say about that? Let’s not get distracted!)Drinks combining juniper‑based spirits with vermouth actually began surfacing well before then, in the early 1800’s. By 1883 they began appearing in newspapers around the U.S., but at that point the beverage was labeled a kind of “Manhattan” - a drink “lightened” with vermouth, but with jenever (the Dutch predecessor of gin) or Old Tom gin rather than whiskey. In the following years, drinks with names such as “Martine”, “Martineau”, “Marteni”, and “Martingny” were regularly ordered across the noisy bars of New York’s clubland - the variations no doubt caused by overhearing the name through the cacophony of a dark club (Party like it’s 1889!).By the 1890’s, The Martini had established itself as the gin-based cousin of the Manhattan, and name stuck - no doubt helped by the name of the dominant vermouth of the age, the Italian Martini & Rossi - which at the time, accounted for two-thirds of the vermouth imported into the United States. By the end of that decade the drink had become one of many important cocktails in every bartender’s arsenal, but hardly the dominant kingpin of cocktailing.The Martini’s Rise to Prominence Through NecessityIt was in the years of Prohibition (1920-1933) in the United States that the Martini began to coalesce into the icon we see it as today. During Prohibition, the Martini surged in popularity largely to make the widely-available, illicit, often homemade “bathtub gin” palatable. Unlike whiskey or rum, which required aging and were harder to produce (and store!) clandestinely, gin could be made quickly and in large quantities with little more than grain alcohol, some juniper and some herbs to macerate in the illicit gin - in a bathtub if need be. This raw, harsh spirit was inconsistent and not always great. It needed something to temper its bite. Aromatic, available, wine-based vermouth fit the bill perfectly.While Prohibition made the production, importation, and sale of all alcohol illegal in the U.S., vermouth - be",

AI agent traffic surged 805% year-over-year on Black Friday 2025, and $67 billion in Cyber Week sales were influenced by AI agents. For fashion and lifestyle brands, the question is no longer whether to prepare for AI-first shopping, but how quickly you can adapt.TL;DR: AI agents now influence 20% of all e-commerce orders. Fashion leaders like SKIMS, Glossier, and Vuori are already live on ChatGPT Instant Checkout. Retailers must choose between ACP and AP2 protocols, optimize catalogs for AI discovery, and act before the 2026 inflection point when Forrester predicts one-quarter of shoppers will use retail chatbots.Why Should Fashion Retailers Care About AI Commerce?AI commerce represents the fastest-growing channel in retail history. According to Salesforce, retailers with AI agents achieved 13% sales growth during Cyber Week 2025, while those without managed only 2%, a 7x performance advantage.Fashion-specific data is compelling:50% of consumers trust AI more than friends for fashion advice (Bloomreach)SKIMS, Glossier, Spanx, and Vuori are live on ChatGPT Instant CheckoutTarget launched multi-item shopping with fresh food and drive-up fulfillmentThe stakes are clear: SAP Emarsys declared that \"2025 will likely be the last year consumers shop as they do now.\"What Protocols Should Fashion Brands Support?Two competing protocols dominate the agentic commerce landscape. Your choice determines which platforms can sell your products. Protocol Developers Platforms Best For ACP (Agentic Commerce Protocol) Stripe + OpenAI ChatGPT, Salesforce, Shopify Merchant control, open standard AP2 (Agent Payments Protocol) Google + 60 partners Google Search, Mastercard, PayPal Payment network integration ACP is live today. Glossier, SKIMS, Spanx, and Vuori already process transactions through ChatGPT Instant Checkout using ACP. PayPal adopted ACP in October 2025, and commercetools joined as a launch partner.AP2 is building ecosystem support. With 60+ partners including Mastercard, PayPal, American Express, and Adobe, AP2 focuses on authorization, traceability, and audit controls across the payments ecosystem.Strategic recommendation: Support both protocols. Protocol fragmentation is real, and fashion brands need presence across ChatGPT (ACP), Google (AP2), and emerging platforms.How Should You Optimize Catalogs for AI Discovery?AI agents behave differently than human shoppers. According to HUMAN Security, 87% of agent requests target product pages directly. Optimization requires structured data that machines can parse instantly.Essential catalog optimizations:Rich product descriptions with material, fit, and care informationComprehensive size guides in machine-readable formatsHigh-quality images with descriptive alt textSchema markup for AI comprehensionInventory and pricing feeds updated in real-timeFor lifestyle brands, aesthetic storytelling matters. As one boutique retailer noted in research calls, \"the aesthetic experience IS the product.\" Solutions include hybrid strategies: AI discovery leads to website visits, which later convert to purchases.Case Studies: Fashion Brands Leading in AI CommerceSKIMS: The Kardashian-backed brand joined ChatGPT Instant Checkout among the first wave of Shopify merchants. Their early adoption follows a pattern of staying ahead of e-commerce trends.Target: Launched a custom ChatGPT app with multi-item cart support, fresh food shopping, and drive-up fulfillment options. Retail Brew described their execution as \"ahead of Walmart.\"Glossier: The beauty and lifestyle brand went live on ChatGPT checkout, positioning for the 50 million daily shopping queries processed through ChatGPT.Vuori: The athleisure brand joined the Shopify merchant cohort on ChatGPT, gaining access to AI-referred shoppers who demonstrate 38% higher completion rates.What Results Can Fashion Retailers Expect?The data from Cyber Week 2025 provides benchmarks:805% YoY growth in AI-driven traffic on Black Friday (Adobe Analytics)38% higher completion rate for shoppers arriving via generative AI32% more time on site for AI-referred visitors27% lower bounce rate compared to traditional referralsAmazon Rufus users were 100% more likely to complete purchases than non-Rufus shoppers on Black Friday.

With that, let’s talk agentic commerce…Agentic Commerce: When AI Does the Shopping for YouOne of the earliest recorded forms of commerce was cattle trade around 10,000 B.C.Cattle had a fixed value and were exchanged for goods and services. The Latin word for money, pecunia, actually comes from pecus, the Latin word for cattle. Nowadays, commerce involves less cattle and more Apple Pay (more convenient, it turns out), but commerce continues to power the economy. About once a year I like to write a piece about what’s happening in commerce; recent examples: The 10 Forces Shaping Commerce (2024)The Wild West of E-Commerce (2023) Talking Shop: The Transformation of Commerce (2022) These pieces usually talk about how commerce has evolved from cattle to credit cards, and where we’re heading next. Last year, for instance, we talked about Ozempic, overstock, creator brands, and sustainable fashion. I often include some version of this chart, too: E-commerce now comprises about 15% of retail sales. That’s because this chart best summarizes the shifts in commerce over the past 30 years. Offline to online. The big disruption was happening in where we were shopping. First we were shopping in malls; then we were shopping on websites; then we were shopping in apps. But each progression still hinged on a core principle: that you were the one doing the shopping.The next overhaul in commerce, is my mind, isn’t a change in where we shop, but in who is doing the shopping. Today I want to talk about agentic commerce. I’m hearing this term more in Pre-Seed and Seed pitches, and BCV’s Scott Friend wrote a good piece last fall arguing that agentic commerce is the natural “third wave” after e-commerce (Wave 1, ushered in with the internet) and mobile (Wave 2, ushered in with the iPhone). It’s interesting to me to question what a future version of the chart above might look like. A 2025 to 2050 version might look something like this: Let’s explore what this could look like. Delegation, Delegation, DelegationWith the rise of AI agents, people are increasingly offloading the stuff they don’t want to do. At work, this means notes and memos and spreadsheets. At home, this means utility-oriented shopping. We’ll start delegating more and more to autonomous agents that understand our preferences and our constraints. What do we mean by that? What Agentic Commerce Will Look LikeIn a few years, you might be sleeping while your AI agent is shopping for your mom’s birthday gift. Your agent finds the gift, negotiates the price, and schedules delivery. This sounds a little uncomfortable: shouldn’t we be the ones putting in the time and effort for mom’s gift? The more likely winning product will build in a bit of friction, inserting moments of human control—moments of delegation. You might wake up to three options for mom’s gift; over your morning coffee, you select one, then instruct your agent to execute the purchase and arrange delivery. If we take a step back, I would broadly separate shopping into two categories: utility shopping and emotional shopping. Utility shopping is buying the stuff we have to—milk and light bulbs and trash bags. Emotional shopping is buying the stuff we want to—handbags and candles and artwork. For future products focused on utility shopping, the right KPI might be minimizing time spent. We don’t want people spending an hour a day on our site. We want you to get in and get out! Amazon is mostly in this category: the checkout experience painstakingly removes friction so that you can order paper towels in just a few seconds. This is why Amazon put a patent on 1-click checkout. For future products focused on emotional shopping, the right KPI might be maximizing time spent. Here, we want people browsing and perusing and discovering new stuff. The best old-school example might be the shopping mall. A more recent example could be something like LTK. A company like Pinterest should have dominated this form of shopping, but never really nailed commerce. Shopping malls are a good example of more discovery-driven, serendipitous shoppingWhen I think about AI innovation in shopping, I think about utility vs. emotional. On the utility side, we’ll have agents that do the dirty work. They hunt for good deals. They re-order our toilet paper. They know mom’s birthday is coming up, and they’re ready to go with a s",

AI agents are no longer experimental—they're becoming the primary interface between brands and customers. For fashion retailers, this shift creates both existential risk and unprecedented opportunity. Brands that optimize for AI visibility today will dominate tomorrow's discovery landscape. Those that don't will watch their products disappear from the conversations that matter most.The Envive Sales Agent represents purpose-built agentic commerce infrastructure for fashion brands—AI that understands fit questions, style preferences, and the nuanced purchase decisions unique to apparel and accessories. Unlike generic chatbots, these agents build confidence, nurture trust, and remove the hesitation that kills fashion conversions.Unlocking Enhanced AI Visibility with Agentic Commerce in Fashion eCommerceThe rules of product discovery have fundamentally changed. When consumers search for fashion items, they're increasingly turning to AI platforms like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google's AI Mode rather than traditional search engines. This shift demands a new strategic approach: optimizing not just for search engines, but for the AI agents that are becoming consumers' trusted shopping advisors.Agentic commerce describes AI systems that don't just answer questions—they take autonomous action on behalf of shoppers. These agents can research products, compare options, negotiate prices, and even complete purchases without requiring the consumer to visit individual brand websites. For fashion brands, this means:Products must be AI-discoverable: If AI agents can't find and understand your products, they won't recommend themBrand narratives must be machine-readable: The stories that differentiate fashion brands need structured data that AI can interpret and conveyTrust signals must be explicit: Reviews, certifications, and brand authority must be formatted for AI comprehensionResearch from Princeton and Georgia Tech demonstrates that brands implementing Generative Experience Optimization (GEO) strategies see 40%+ improvements in AI visibility. This isn't marginal—it's the difference between appearing in AI-mediated shopping conversations or being excluded entirely.The fashion industry faces unique AI visibility challenges. Style is subjective. Fit is personal. Trends shift seasonally. Generic AI models struggle with these nuances, often providing recommendations that miss the mark on brand positioning or customer intent. Purpose-built fashion AI agents solve this by learning the specific language, aesthetics, and customer expectations of each brand.How Agentic Commerce Drives Conversion and Customer LoyaltyThe conversion impact of AI agents in fashion ecommerce is substantial and measurable. While the 2.4% conversion rate is the median for fashion ecommerce, brands deploying sophisticated AI shopping assistants consistently outperform this benchmark by significant margins.Consider the results from brands that have implemented agentic commerce solutions:Spanx achieved a 100%+ conversion increase with AI-powered shopping assistance, generating $3.8M in annualized incremental revenue and a 38x return on spendSupergoop! saw an 11.5% conversion rate increase, translating to 5,947 monthly incremental orders and $5.35M in annualized incremental revenueCarBahn customers became 13x more likely to add to cart and 10x more likely to complete purchases when engaging with AI guidanceThese aren't anomalies—they reflect the fundamental shift in how AI agents transform hesitation into confidence. Fashion purchases involve risk: Will this fit? Does this match my style? Is this worth the price? AI agents that can answer these personal questions in real-time eliminate the friction that traditionally causes cart abandonment.The loyalty implications extend beyond initial conversion.

A quick primer on agentic commerce Picture this: You’re a Hollywood star with an assistant who caters to every wish and whim. Need to prepare for a new movie? Your assistant shortlists, recommends and books personal trainers and specialists for the skills you need to develop. Want to organize a trip across Asia for a couple of months? Your assistant organizes the itinerary, books every flight and hotel, engages local guides for exclusive tours and even reserves tables at the restaurants of your preference. With the right requirements and budget, this concierge-of-sorts can research, select and shop on behalf of a shopper, who doesn’t have to waste time with mundane tasks. Agentic commerce has emerged to make this reality possible for anyone, albeit in the digital world. AI agents can help automate complex tasks that, if done manually, would require a ton of time.

Every week for the past 4 years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news... STAT OF THE WEEK: OpenAI's new Sora app was downloaded over one million times in less than five days, even faster than ChatGPT hit the milestone despite only being available in North America and by invitation only. The app is now #1 in Photo & Video on the Apple App store, but unfortunately it's only got a 2.8 star rating out of 3,500 reviews, with many users complaining about its guardrails being too restrictive. On Thursday, China issued new export restrictions on rare earth elements and minerals, adding five new elements and extra scrutiny for semiconductor users and dozens of pieces of refining technology to its control list. On Friday, Trump said he will impose an additional 100% tariff on imports from China, as well as impose export controls on “any and all critical software” starting Nov 1st, in retaliation of China's new export restrictions. Following the news on Friday, the S&P 500 dropped 2.7%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 1.8% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.6%. It also sparked a massive $18.28B cryptocurrency sell-off late Friday, which is the largest liquidation event in crypto history. On Sunday, China defended its new rare earth export controls, which began on Oct 9th, explaining that the measures are “designed to better safeguard world peace and regional stability\" and called Trump's plan to impose another 100% tariff a \"classic case of double standards.\" Beijing later said that it doesn't want a tariff war, but it's ready for one. Etsy is overhauling its Insider buyer membership program, replacing its ambitious free shipping benefits with a 5% Etsy credit on purchases starting November 4th. The credits, which cap at $2,000 earned, do not expire as long as you continue paying the annual membership fee. Etsy will cover up to $6 in shipping costs on the least expensive U.S. domestic shipping option for orders over $15, with the buyer paying the difference. (Previously, Etsy covered up to $20 worth of shipping for all Insider orders.) Etsy's Chief Growth Officer said that the first version of Etsy Insiders \"didn't provide scalable economics.\" Who could've predicted that? PayPal launched Ads Manager, a new way for small businesses to earn revenue from their websites through display advertising. They are marketing it very strangely, claiming PayPal Ads Manager allows small businesses \"to become their own retail media networks and generate new revenue streams\" -- but in actuality PayPal is the one launching a retail media network .Small businesses are simply being given a new opportunity to display ads on their website from PayPal — instead of Amazon, Google, Taboola, Mediavine, etc. Despite the odd positinoing, I think it's reat that they're doing this because I support competition in the retail media ad space, and with PayPal's extensive transaction graph, its retail media network has the ability to spend advertiser dollars effectively with highly targeted advertisements, assuming they can get enough businesses on board as publishers to create a network effect. Last week at OpenAI's annual developer conference, DevDay, the company unveiled new products, partnerships, and platform upgrades aimed at transforming ChatGPT from a single product into a full operating system for AI applications. Highlights include the release of GPT-5 Pro and the introduction of ChatGPT Apps, which let developers build interactive experiences directly inside ChatGPT conversations, such as booking travel, managing spreadsheets, or shopping online. A new ChatGPT App Store will allow developers to distribute and monetize their creations. The launch follows its previous attempts to let developers build interactive applications through its GPT Store, however, this new launch puts apps directly in ChatGPT’s responses and lets users call up third-party tools in their everyday conversations. For example, users can now say “Zillow, find me 5 bed 4 bath houses in Waynesville NC for under $1M” to call up the Zillow app. Last week, three major BNPL providers entered the race to make their installment payments a native part of the agentic shopping experience. Affirm and Klarna announced that they are both supporting Google’s Agent Payments Protocol (AP2), an open-source, payment-agnostic framework designed to enable agent-led payments across platforms. The collaboration allows AI-powered agents to offer pay-over-time options within automated transactions. Splitit introduced its Agentic Commerce Partner Program, an invite-only pilot aimed at embedding installment payments directly into AI shopping agents. ",

Vidhya Srinivasan VP/GM Ads and Commerce Read AI-generated summary Bullet points \"New Tech and Tools for Retailers\" discusses AI's role in agentic shopping and retail growth. The Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) is a new open standard for agentic commerce across platforms. Business Agent lets shoppers chat with brands directly on Search, like a virtual sales associate. New Merchant Center data attributes help retailers get discovered in conversational commerce. Direct Offers in Google Ads let retailers present exclusive discounts to shoppers ready to buy. Summaries were generated by Google AI. Generative AI is experimental. Share x.com Facebook LinkedIn Mail Copy link The pace of innovation in retail is incredible, and agentic commerce — where AI completes tasks on people’s behalf — is evolving from a concept to reality. Last year, we introduced agentic tools for shoppers and made agent-led payments seamless and secure with our Agent Payments Protocol (AP2). We believe in an agentic commerce future that is open, collaborative and built for everyone to succeed. Partnering with leading retailers and platforms, we’re sharing several announcements today that are an important step in that journey.Unlock retail growth with a new open standardToday, we’re launching the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP), a new open standard for agentic commerce that works across the entire shopping journey — from discovery and buying to post-purchase support. UCP establishes a common language for agents and systems to operate together across consumer surfaces, businesses and payment providers. So instead of requiring unique connections for every individual agent, UCP enables all agents to interact easily. UCP is built to work across verticals and is compatible with existing industry protocols like Agent2Agent (A2A), Agent Payments Protocol (AP2) and Model Context Protocol (MCP).UCP was co-developed with industry leaders including Shopify, Etsy, Wayfair, Target and Walmart, and endorsed by more than 20 others across the ecosystem like Adyen, American Express, Best Buy, Flipkart, Macy’s Inc., Mastercard, Stripe, The Home Depot, Visa and Zalando. Support of the Universal Commerce Protocol from across the ecosystem. To start, UCP will soon power a new checkout feature on eligible Google product listings in AI Mode in Search and the Gemini app, allowing shoppers to check out from eligible U.S. retailers right as they’re researching on Google. The feature is built with security at its core: shoppers can buy confidently with Google Pay using payment methods and shipping info already saved in Google Wallet and soon, will be able to make a purchase with PayPal. Retailers remain the seller of record, with the ability to customize the integration to their specific needs, all while helping to capture sales and avoid abandoned carts. In the coming months, we’ll work with retailers to expand globally and add more capabilities — like discovering related products, applying loyalty rewards, and powering custom shopping experiences on Google. Buy directly from eligible retailers on Google’s AI surfaces. Connect with customers using a branded AI agentWe’re also launching Business Agent, a new way for shoppers to chat with brands, right on Search. It’s like a virtual sales associate that can answer product questions in a brand’s voice, enabling retailers to connect with consumers during critical shopping moments and help drive sales.Business Agent is live starting tomorrow with retailers like Lowe’s, Michael’s, Poshmark, Reebok and others. Eligible U.S. retailers can choose to activate and customize this branded agent in Merchant Center. In the coming months, they’ll be able to train the agent based on their data, access new customer insights, provide offers for related products and enable direct purchases — including agentic checkout — within the experience. Shoppers can chat with eligible retailers directly on Search. Optimize your presence in the conversational commerce eraThe way people shop is changing, but our goal remains the same: to help retailers get discovered. That’s why we’re announcing dozens of new data attributes in Merchant Center designed for easy discovery in the conversational commerce era, on surfaces like AI Mode, Gemini and Business Agent. These new attributes complement retailers’ existing data feeds and go beyond traditional keywords to include things like answers to common product questions, compatible accessories or substitutes. We will be rolling these out with a small group of retailers soon and expanding to more in the coming months.Introducing Direct OffersAs shoppers turn to AI for discovery, retailers need smarter ways to deliver value.

After a decade of expansion, driven by demand in both established and emerging markets, the industry is now grappling with reduced sales and consumer spending priorities. According to Bain & Company (2023), luxury brands are facing heightened pressure to innovate and adapt to this changing landscape.This new era calls for creativity, market customization, and operational efficiency, and AI-driven solutions like yoona.ai are poised to help luxury brands respond to these challenges. Here's how:1. More Reactive to TrendsSpeed and agility are now crucial in the luxury sector, as traditional volume-driven strategies fall short in a market where consumers are prioritizing exclusivity and unique experiences over mass appeal. A recent report by McKinsey & Company (2023) highlights that being able to quickly react to consumer trends is becoming a competitive necessity.By using yoona.ai’s AI-powered trend analysis, brands can reduce their time to market by 85.67%. This capability is essential as brands face declining sales. For example, LVMH recently reported a 5% drop in fashion and leather goods sales in Q3 2024, while Kering’s Gucci saw a staggering 25% decrease . In this climate, yoona.ai's ability to generate data-backed insights enables brands to quickly develop and release products that align with fast-moving consumer preferences, ensuring they remain relevant in a volatile market. yoona.ai Data Science Tool 2. Market-Specific DesignsThe growing importance of regional markets such as India, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East is highlighted by Bain & Company’s Luxury Goods Worldwide Market Study (2023), which emphasizes the need for localized approaches. As consumer demand weakens in previously dominant markets like China, brands must tap into these emerging regions with tailored designs that resonate with local preferences and cultural nuances.Yoona.ai leverages machine learning and market data to help brands create market-specific collections. This allows luxury houses to stay competitive by offering designs that appeal directly to regional tastes while maintaining the exclusivity and craftsmanship that define luxury. In a market where 16% of Kering’s overall sales dropped in Q3 2024, focusing on regional customization can offer a path to stability and growth. Dress generated by yoona.ai for South Asia 3. Streamlined Design ProcessEfficiency in the design process is essential, particularly as brands aim to balance creativity with cost control and sustainability. As noted in McKinsey’s Technology in Fashion Report (2022), sustainability is becoming a central pillar for luxury brands, and consumers are increasingly demanding eco-conscious practices.Yoona.ai addresses this need by streamlining the entire design process, from concept to execution, leading to a 93% reduction in material waste. This not only makes the design process more sustainable but also more efficient, freeing designers to focus on creativity rather than administrative tasks. With Hermès projected to report its slowest growth since 2021, focusing on quality and sustainability, supported by tools like yoona.ai, becomes a key strategy for long-term success. See full white paper report here https://www.yoona.ai/sustainability-paper Enhanced Insights Using Data:Luxury Market Growth: The Bain & Company study (2023) outlines slowing growth across the luxury sector, reinforcing the need for brands to adopt reactive technologies to keep up with changing consumer preferences.AI-Powered Trend Analysis: McKinsey (2023) stresses that brands that can integrate AI to predict and react quickly to market shifts will have a clear advantage over those that rely on traditional methods .Sustainability as a Key Differentiator: According to the McKinsey Technology Report (2022), sustainability is increasingly linked to luxury, and tools like yoona.ai that help brands reduce material waste are essential for future competitiveness .ConclusionAs the luxury industry navigates shrinking sales, changing consumer preferences, and regional opportunities, the ability to stay trend-reactive, develop market-specific designs, and streamline the design process will be critical. The era of relying on heavy marketing and celebrity endorsements to drive demand is over.With tools like yoona.ai, brands can adopt a data-driven approach that ensures agility, market relevance, and sustainability, positioning themselves to thrive in this new era of luxury retail.Bibliography/References:Bain & Company (2023).

    "extractedText": "The Luxury Revolution: Innovation, AI and the Future of FashionVogue College EditorialJuly 16, 2025 In today’s fast-moving luxury market, innovation is more than just a buzzword.From AI-powered experiences to immersive digital activations, luxury houses are transforming their business models and redefining what prestige means in the modern age. This evolution is reshaping the skills, strategies, and mindsets that luxury professionals need. The MA International Luxury Business (Online) program at Vogue College of Fashion is designed for future leaders who want to understand, drive and lead this change in a connected world. Rethinking Luxury for the Digital Age According to Elaine Parr, consumer leader of EMEA, IBM, in Evolve or Fade Away: Enriching Luxury Heritage in the AI Era (Vogue Business x IBM, January 2025), “The luxury industry, a business built on timeless heritage and unparalleled craftsmanship, stands at a pivotal juncture. Once unassailable, we see a softening market, with 2025 set to be among the most challenging on record. At the same time, there is a delicate balance between enriching legacy and being future facing; moving at the pace of today’s tech to stay relevant.” Consumers now expect luxury to meet them where they are: on their devices, in virtual worlds, and across seamless on- and offline experiences. Whether it’s the rise of AI-generated collections, gamified campaigns, or personalised clienteling through data insights, luxury brands are using innovation to cultivate deeper emotional connections with their audiences. AI and Virtual Craftsmanship Artificial Intelligence is now influencing everything from trend forecasting to digital design. Some brands are even using AI to reinterpret archival designs or tailor customer experiences in real time. This shift is not about replacing human creativity but enhancing it with new tools and possibilities. Virtual design software and generative AI tools are empowering designers to prototype and iterate faster while reducing waste and improving sustainability — key concerns for the future of the industry. By reducing textile waste, shortening production timelines and enabling on-demand customisation, this technology is transforming what craftsmanship means in the 21st century—without compromising creativity or care. Immersive Brand Worlds From virtual catwalks to interactive flagship store experiences, luxury brands are redefining the runway and the retail floor through digital storytelling. These are carefully crafted ecosystems that fuse art, technology and narrative to create unforgettable moments of connection. Whether it’s Gucci’s Roblox sneakers, Louis Vuitton’s metaverse collaborations, or Chanel’s multisensory installations, the goal is clear: to create experiences where consumers don’t just observe luxury—they inhabit it. These touchpoints offer new spaces for emotion, engagement and loyalty, especially as the next generation of luxury consumers seeks meaning, not just status. At Vogue College of Fashion, students are actively engaging with this future. In the AI Meets High Fashion workshop, students explored how creative AI tools are reshaping fashion storytelling, from digital garments to generative design processes. To explore these frontiers further, Vogue College of Fashion launched the Fashion Media Futures Symposium, a one-day event that brought together thought leaders across media, AI, tech and fashion. From live panel discussions to student-led creative showcases, the symposium spotlighted how emerging platforms and technologies are reshaping the future of fashion communication. Future-Proof Your Luxury Career As the luxury industry evolves, so must the people shaping it. The MA International Luxury Business (Online) at Vogue College of Fashion equips students to confidently navigate this changing landscape. Johannes Reponen, Global Academic Director at Vogue College of Fashion, shares: “The online MA in International Luxury Business represents the future of fashion and luxury careers. This flexible, comprehensive program is designed to meet the needs of modern professionals and equips them with the skills necessary to lead in an increasingly digital and global luxury market.” Delivered online for maximum flexibility, the program helps students: Develop a strategic understanding of global luxury trends Explore how technology is redefining customer experience and value Build leadership skills in an increasingly digital-first industry Whether you’re pivoting careers or enhancing your expertise, this future-focused master’s helps you stay ahead of the curve in a competitive global industry.

ByJennifer Leigh Parker,Contributor.Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Covering the future of luxury travel. Follow AuthorJan 15, 2026, 12:31pm ESTCEO Maud Bailly inside the newly renovated Sofitel New York.Courtesy Sofitel Consensus from the C-Suite of the largest hospitality companies, including Accor, Marriott, Hyatt, Four Seasons, Rosewood — many of whom I spoke with at the International Luxury Travel Market (ILTM) conference in December — is pretty clear: AI can’t replace the need for humans in hospitality, but it does present a “huge unlock” for travel planning and personalization in a highly personal business. AI technology can help hoteliers and travel agents assemble detailed client profiles, enrich experiences, and deliver deeply customized recommendations, beyond simple booking tasks. But most hotel companies can’t demonstrate a clear return on investment from AI tools — at least not yet. Which is why I sat down with Maud Bailly, the French executive who has not only found a way to generate a return using AI, but she’s improving sustainability practices at the same time. Since 2023, she has served as CEO of Sofitel, Sofitel Legend, MGallery & Emblems, four of Accor’s luxury-and-lifestyle brands. The terrace of the \"Chrysler View Suite\" at Sofitel New YorkCourtesy SofitelWhy it matters: She’s operating under the Accor umbrella. Accor is a French multinational hospitality company and one of the world’s largest hotel groups, with a portfolio of 5,760 hotels worldwide (according to the company’s latest quarterly earnings statement), and a market capitalization of 10.8 billion euro, as of January 15. When this company makes moves, everyone pays attention. What Bailly does with Sofitel, a 60-year old French brand backed by Accor, can tell us a lot about how luxury hotels are grappling with technology at scale. Her mandate is to fully revamp what she herself has called an “aging lady that needs a lift,” while attempting to steer an ambitious expansion plan. Currently, Sofitel operates 119 hotels worldwide. Of these, approximately one third are under renovation, and there are 39 new hotels in the pipeline for completion by 2030— in such far-flung locales as India, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt. Under Bailly’s tenure, 22 owners have signed on as Sofitel-branded properties and two U.S. hotels have completed full top-to-tail renovations: Sofitel New York and Sofitel Montreal Golden Mile. Perched confidently in Sofitel New York’s rather chic penthouse, with the steel gray backdrop of midtown Manhattan behind her, Bailly presented her future plans to reshape the public’s perception of Sofitel and its global footprint. There are plenty of industry skeptics who doubt it can be done. So, what’s her AI strategy? Here’s what she had to say: I'm interested in your thoughts on AI. Is there a clear return here? I think we need to be very lucid. It's still the very early stage of AI, and we need to remain humble. On the other hand, we are already leveraging AI, but on very specific applications. For example: We are very committed to sustainability with very strong KPIs [key performance indicators], with a very strong roadmap. It's not greenwashing. We are committed to sustainable luxury. Let's work on food waste. We've been using AI tools called Winnow Solutions and Orbisk. [These are AI-powered food-waste tracking systems used by hotels and other commercial kitchens to monitor what’s being thrown out so teams can adjust purchasing, prep and menus to cut waste.]By implementing those tools within the hotels, we managed to reduce between 50%-60% the average amount of food waste every month. You are ordering less food, spending less money, and transporting less. Which means less carbon emissions. You are saving money, and you are also more respectful to the planet. I love buffets. I love this kind of generosity in hotels. But we can't keep working like this, especially in our world. So, sustainability use cases are already live and have been demonstrating a massive positive impact. In Sofitel Le Scribe Paris Opéra, a water filtration system was installed, eliminating the use of plastic water bottles.SofitelReporter’s Note: Bailly has implemented programs to eliminate single use plastics across Sofitel hotels, such as retrofitting buildings with water filtration systems that eliminate the need for plastic bottles in-room. She is also known for pushing for the full eco-certification of her hotels, the results of which are published in Accor’s 2024 Sustainability Report.

    "extractedText": "Artificial Intelligence (AI), Customer Retention, Marketing December 16, 2025 Listening, Not Selling: How AI is Changing Luxury Brand Loyalty Credit: Getty Images by oatawa By Zsuzsa Kecsmar Facebook Facebook Twitter Twitter LinkedIn LinkedIn Email Email The $472 billion global retail luxury market faces an interesting tension. Shoppers crave the kind of deeply personal experiences that artificial intelligence makes possible, yet they’re cautious about how much data they share. Once loyalty was all about collecting points or signing up for discounts; now it's something more emotional. People don’t want to be sold to in the same way. They want to feel known, understood and valued. They want to buy from brands that see them as individuals rather than data points. They want early drops and unique experiences that make them feel special. For brands, this opens up a chance to rethink what loyalty looks like, using AI to anticipate needs, build trust, and create lasting relationships. AI as an Attention Giver What AI does so well is help brands listen more closely. It spots the small clues that people leave behind when they browse, buy or engage online, and turns them into insight and intelligence. That might mean recognizing when someone is about to lose interest or predicting what they might want next. Brands like SKIMS and LuisaViaRoma are already using smart customer retention tactics through their loyalty programs. And in an industry where trends move fast, being able to respond quickly and personally is essential for keeping consumers captivated. In fact, 87.7 percent of surveyed retail executives think micro-targeting has a positive impact on customer retention and satisfaction. It’s this prediction that AI does best. It takes patterns that would be impossible for humans to see and uses them to anticipate behavior. If a businessperson regularly buys a new suit every few months, AI can sense when they're likely to start looking again and send a well-timed reminder or suggestion that can make the difference between a lost sale and a returning customer. The result feels less like being sold to and more like being helped by a friendly assistant. That’s the mindset we need. The beauty of AI is that it allows personalization at scale. It’s not mass marketing or even traditional segmentation categories. We’ve gone beyond female 25-35. Instead of broad segments, it can create thousands of tiny ones. A newsletter can show different content to each reader; a homepage can adapt to what someone has viewed before; even the tone of a message can shift to match a customer’s style. These changes might seem small, but together they build a sense that a brand is paying attention. And our data shows people want it: 39.6 percent of consumers are more likely to join a loyalty program that uses AI to improve their experience, showing a clear appetite for this kind of intelligent interaction when it provides real value. Trust as the Foundation of Loyalty When recommendations feel relevant rather than random or salesy, people are more open to hearing from a brand again. They trust that you’re on their side and it’s a team effort. It’s this trust that turns convenience into connection, and is the foundation of loyalty. Once that feeling of connection is there, loyalty starts to grow naturally. Customers come back, engage more deeply and share their positive experiences. It becomes a habit rather than a decision. They always shop with you. And AI can even help strengthen that habit through gentle nudges and reminders. Maybe a note that their favorite items are nearly back in stock, or an invitation to an exclusive preview. Done right, it feels like a friend keeping you in the loop of something you want to know more about. Data + Tech + Human Underpinning all of this is data. For AI to work well, the data has to be clean, consistent and connected. If customer information is scattered across systems or out-of-date, then even the smartest algorithm will struggle. The result can be clumsy messaging that does the opposite of building loyalty — out of touch, tone deaf, frustratingly clunky. Brands that want to use AI effectively need to invest in the basics first. It's also worth remembering that as excited as we all are in the industry, AI is only a tool. Technology can guide and enhance but it cannot replace genuine brand personality and effective marketing. Customers can sense when messages are robotic or forced. Human voice still matters. The most effective use of AI is when it supports creativity, freeing people to focus on storytelling, ideas and empathy. Brands and retailers shouldn’t be rushing to replace their teams any time soon, but rather working with them and allowing AI to augment what they do, with the customer always the focus. In the end, I don’t think AI will reinvent loyalty so much as reimagine how it feels for consumers. It’s always been about trust. The technology makes it possible to understand people in more human",

But as the battle for consumer attention heats up, luxury brands bend budgets to stand out.Innovation can be characterised by the consumer need for newness and utility. As the pillar that’s most susceptible to change, it is undeniable that even since the last Vogue Business Index in H2 2024, the hype cycle has roared on, ushering in — and out — some of the technologies that are key to luxury’s survival. From the continued wane of NFTs and the rise of digital twins, to the influx of digital product passports (DPPs) and the climbing industry demand for transparency, it is vital for brands to continuously recalibrate their innovation strategies to stay relevant, especially as legislation looms.During our data capture period for H1 2025, artificial intelligence was front of mind for consumers. And alongside struggling to prioritise innovation within tightened budgets, Index brands are grappling with how to ethically adopt and apply AI to their practices, too.Innovation moversIn this chapter, we dive into the innovations of Index brands, from their involvement in circular solutions such as rental and resale to their presence in gaming. Research is conducted via an audit of their long-term and point-in-time (past year) activations, with individual metrics weighted to consumer importance.Following movements among the top players in the last edition of the Vogue Business Index, shuffles in the innovation pillar continue, albeit more drastic. Gucci, which has held the top spot in innovation since its addition in H1 2022, drops for the first time in three years to third place, as Balenciaga (+5) and Burberry (+10) overtake.Balenciaga now follows in the footsteps of its sister brand Gucci in leading the way when it comes to innovation. As a pioneer of cryptocurrency payments, which it rolled out across limited boutiques in May 2022, Balenciaga has long innovated in interesting and unique ways, most recently launching its virtual runway for the Apple Vision Pro and collaborating with the Need For Speed mobile game to target a localised crowd. What sets Balenciaga apart from other luxury brands is the way it leans into innovation through subculture — something that ties into the brand’s inherent values of creativity and subverting the status quo. Balenciaga Music, for example, launched in May 2024, is a platform that aligns subculture with innovation, through curated playlists and NFC-chipped garments that offer exclusive access to tunes once scanned.An early adopter of all forms of innovation, Gucci has previously led in areas such as gaming, NFTs and resale, through its own initiatives and collaborations. As Gucci adopts a back-to-basics approach — first witnessed under the appointment of Sabato De Sarno in January 2023, and his more minimal approach to design — innovation has been somewhat scaled back. Gucci Arcade, first launched in 2019, has quietly been removed from the brand’s website navigation, with games including Gucci Gravity and Gucci Labyrinth no longer accessible. While Gucci-themed virtual world Gucci Town on gaming platform Roblox remains ongoing, activations within the space have stalled following the maison’s Spring/Summer 2024 Ancora show.Gaming isn’t the only area where Gucci is scaling back investment. Just one year after launching its proprietary resale platform Gucci Vintage, the secondhand offering has quietly shuttered alongside two other brand-led platforms: Hugo Boss Pre-Loved and Valentino Vintage. Now, just nine brands directly operate their resale platforms or white label solutions — down from a peak of 13 brands in the H1 2024 Vogue Business Index — and a further eight brands have partnerships wi",

Each week I post a summary recap of this week's top stories, which I cover in depth in the newsletter.. STAT OF THE WEEK: Adobe forecasts online holiday spending will exceed $221 billion this year. Mobile shopping is expected to make up more than half of that amount.. Uber is now offering return package shipping through UPS, FedEx, and USPS. Customers can send up to five packages at a time for a flat $5 fee or $3 for Uber One members, its $9.99/month subscription plan. In comparison, FedEx charges between $3-4 per package, UPS charges $13 for same-day pickup and $8 for future-day pickup, plus up to a $6.50 surcharge for picking up from a residence, and USPS offers free package pickup from your home or office. (USPS is amazing.). One of my favorite publications, Rest of the World, created a report that highlights 40 global companies that are outmaneuvering Silicon Valley for market share domination in their respective countries. Highlights include PhonePE (480M registered users, beating Google Pay and WhatsApp Pay), Nubank (largest digital bank in the world, based in Brazil), Grab (ride-hailing app that beat Uber in SEA), and BYD (Chinese-made EV about to overtake Tesla).. A redacted portion of the FTC's antitrust lawsuit against Amazon has come to light, offering more details about a secret pricing algorithm known as Project Nessie. Inside sources spoke to the WSJ and claimed that the algorithm was used to test how high Amazon could raise prices before being undercut, automatically return prices to their previous lower levels when rivals did not match their hikes, and discount goods if a competitor reduced prices -- which Amazon says is just normal retail behaviors.. At its annual Refresh event, Squarespace announced several new platform features. The standout feature added was Squarespace Payments, a native payment solution that will let business users collect money for goods and services without having to integrate an external payment processor. This is Squarespace's answer to Shop Pay and Woo Payments.. Flipkart launched Flipkart Commerce Cloud, a suite of retail tech solutions including Marketplace Technology Stack (helps retailers launch marketplaces), Retail Media Solution (ad engine that understands shopper intent), and Retail Pricing Manager (cloud-based SaaS pricing tool).. Flipkart launched its VIP subscription program in preparation for the festive season of sales, taking on Amazon's Prime membership in India. The membership will be priced at Rs 499 annually ($5.99/year), undercutting Amazon Prime in the country which is priced at Rs 1499 annually ($17.99/year). In response to the Flipkart VIP program, Amazon launched Prime Shopping Edition for Android, which gives users access to free shipping and one-day deliveries for Rs 399 ($4.79/year), but does not include access to Prime Video, Music, Reading, Gaming, or other offerings.. Google and Yahoo announced new email-sending policies that could impact e-commerce merchants. The policies require: E-mail Authentication via SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, Single-click unsubscribes when sending more than 5k e-mails a day, and Low complaint rates (reported Spam rates of less than 0.3%). Historically it's been recommended that companies authenticate their e-mails using the tools above, but now Google and Yahoo are making them requirements versus recommendations.. PayPal was hit with a class action lawsuit by consumers alleging that its anti-steering rules stifle competition against lower-cost payment platforms such as Stripe and Shopify. PayPal's rules say that if a retailer accepts PayPal or Venmo payments, they agree NOT to offer discounts or incentives to persuade consumers to use other payment options, tell customers that other payment options are more cost effective, or present other forms of payment earlier in the checkout process. The suit states that PayPal’s merchant agreement leads to consumers paying more to make purchases, which “if PayPal’s agreements were transparent, consumers would quickly see a price difference between PayPal and Venmo and its competitors.”. Pitney Bowes is evaluating if the company should sell off its global e-commerce business unit, which provides retailers with a parcel delivery and returns network and other fulfillment services. Last week the company's President and CEO Marc B. Lautenbach stepped down, effective immediately, after being pressured by a large investor to do so from both roles. He also resigned his seat on the company’s board. Jason Dies, who most recently served as the company’s executive VP and group president, was named interim CEO, while the company searches for a permanent successor..

The Untappd Shop, an independent platform which allows consumers using the award-winning Untappd app to buy beer for shipment to their doorsteps, launched in select states in the U.S. in October 2023. With today’s launch, customers in The Netherlands will now be able to purchase beer from leading breweries around the world, including from the United States, for home shipment. The Untappd Shop features curated boxes, bundles featuring select breweries, and singles from a wide range of breweries. To celebrate the launch, the Untappd Shop put on sale today the Untappd Limited Edition Launch Box: Best of the U.S. beer box featuring 18 top-rated beers from U.S. breweries, including Other Half, Equilibrium, Finback, and Parish, that have never previously been available in Europe. This limited edition box is only available in the Untappd app and the first of a recurring series of curated beer boxes the Untappd Shop will offer featuring highly-rated beers from around the world. The Untappd app is free to download via the App Store and Google Play. Untappd app users are also able to create custom boxes of beers based on previous ratings from their Untappd check-ins. Dare to Drink Different (“DtDD”), as part of Royal Swinkels, emerged with the aim of uniting various flavors and styles, offering craft beer enthusiasts an adventure through the diverse world of beer. DtDD is the ideal Untappd Shop procurement and fulfillment partner due to its ability and willingness to support brewers outside of its own portfolio, its reputation as a leader in innovation in alcohol eCommerce, and, with aims to expand Untappd Shop beyond The Netherlands into other European countries, its global logistics capabilities and footprint. “We are thrilled to launch the Untappd Shop to Dutch consumers. We have worked successfully with the DtDD team at Royal Swinkels for over a half-decade on various software, insights, and marketing initiatives and are thrilled to partner to bring the Untappd Shop to life for European consumers, beginning in The Netherlands,” said Trace Smith, CEO of Next Glass. “We feel DtDD’s approach to providing an open platform as well as the brewery’s eCommerce experience and infrastructure make it the perfect partner for our European B2C eCommerce expansion. The innovative team at DtDD also recognizes continued shifts in consumer behavior, with an increasing share of beer drinkers interested in discovery and exploration options made possible through eCommerce channels like Untappd Shop.” While DDtD maintains its own platform with its own portfolio of products, the Untappd Shop will feature its own custom catalog of products that is continuously expanding to feature new brands. “In line with the philosophy of Dare to Drink Different, we aim to assist beer enthusiasts in discovering more flavors and gaining access to beers they might not typically choose or have the opportunity to try. Untappd is the platform par excellence where all these experiences are shared, and we are proud to now partner to broaden the beer landscape for beer fans,” said Romke Swinkels, managing director Dutch market. He added, “We are delighted with the trust that Untappd has placed in us and look forward to supplying the most exceptional beers for the community!” The unveiling of the Untappd Shop into The Netherlands represents the latest in Next Glass’s expansion efforts in Europe, where the company’s Untappd for Business menu publication and promotional product and Ollie brewery management solution are already used by thousands of retailers and breweries. With the accelerated growth of craft beer share in Europe, nearly half of all Untappd app activity now occurs in Europe. Tom Maneschijn, Vice President, Europe at Next Glass added, “The Netherlands is the second most active country on Untappd, so it is fitting that we begin our European expansion with Untappd Shop here. We look forward to providing a great selection of the very best American and European beers to Dutch consumers.” About the Untappd Shop The Untappd Shop enables Untappd app users to search, discover, and buy beers from around the world for shipment to their front door. The Untappd Shop launched in select U.S. states in October 2023 and is now available in The Netherlands with aims to add additional U.S. states and European countries in 2024.

Hannaford plans to roll out a revised website and app next week that will offer new features to online shoppers, the Ahold Delhaize-owned supermarket chain said in an email to customers on Tuesday. The updated Hannaford To Go e-commerce platform, due to launch on Oct. 28, will include an improved search engine that will allow customers to find items more quickly. The system will also let people pre-select substitutions while they shop as well as approve or reject the suggested alternatives before their order is delivered or ready for pickup. In addition, the platform will accept additional forms of payment, including EBT and Apple Pay, Hannaford said. However, the New England supermarket will stop accepting payments and coupons curbside when it switches to the updated platform. Hannaford’s shift to the new online grocery shopping system will make it the last of Ahold Delhaize USA’s five banners to transition to the company’s proprietary digital and e-commerce platform, known as Prism. Speaking during Ahold Delhaize’s second-quarter earnings call in August, Ahold Delhaize President and CEO Frans Muller noted that Food Lion moved to Prism during that quarter and that Hannaford would be next to start using the platform in a move that would complete the Dutch grocery company’s deployment of the technology stateside. Hannaford’s online grocery operations were disrupted for several days last November by a cyberattack that impacted Ahold Delhaize USA’s network and forced it to take some systems offline. Ahold Delhaize later reported that the digital intrusion also exposed sensitive information belonging to more than 2 million people, including current and former employees as well as their dependents and beneficiaries. Hannaford operates approximately 190 grocery stores in Maine, New Hampshire, New York, Massachusetts and Vermont.
