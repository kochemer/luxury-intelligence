What is it? Element is Walmart’s cloud-agnostic, model-agnostic AI development platform, powering dozens of smart apps used by store personnel daily. Think of it as an assembly line for AI apps, streamlined, scalable, and built entirely in-house. What it does: - Combines data from 240M+ customers & 2M+ employees - Automatically selects optimal open-source models based on performance & cost - Deploys across Google Cloud, Azure, and Walmart’s own infrastructure - Ensures governance, cost control, and explainability from the ground up Examples in action: - Shift planning: Predicts staffing needs, manages clock-ins, and schedules - VizPick: to find high-demand inventory in the backroom - Real-time translation: Supports 44 languages, customised for Walmart lingo Operating across 19 countries and 10,000+ stores, Element is not just a tech experiment, it’s a business transformation engine. The takeaway? Don’t just adopt AI. Assemble your own AI factory. 21 8 Comments Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook X Anant Shukla 5mo Report this comment Walmart turning AI into an assembly line is such a smart move. It’s like rethinking the process itself, not just the tools...makes me wonder how many industries could benefit from this kind of approach.

How does Element balance empowering teams to build quickly with the need to enforce model standardisation? Preventing fragmentation and the resulting technical debt seems like the hardest part of making the “AI factory” model sustainable long-term.
