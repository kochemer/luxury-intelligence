Generating insights will not be enough – strategic advantage comes from integrating AI into better decision-making and faster execution. Strategy teams need to redesign how they work to compete effectively in an AI-first environment. Download the PDF. Artificial intelligence is transforming the practice of strategy by breaking down cognitive and technical limits that once constrained decision-making. It gives organizations access to vast new amounts of data and intelligence, as well as powerful new tools to detect market signals faster and model complex scenarios more effectively.As these powerful tools proliferate, insights alone are no longer a source of competitive advantage. With more companies and competitors building AI capabilities in strategy, what will set them apart is how effectively they integrate AI into decision-making and act on what they learn. The payoff promises to be tremendous, giving organizations clarity to move faster and with greater confidence.To unlock this full potential, the strategy function itself must evolve. Most strategy teams still follow annual planning cycles, disconnected from day-to-day decisions. That approach can’t keep up with the speed at which AI generates insight or markets shift. To compete, strategy teams must become more dynamic and advance alongside the technology to elevate the quality of decisions for organizations.How does an organization rewire its strategy function for an AI-first world? It begins by re-engineering how strategy works, embedding AI as a core capability across the full arc of strategic work. This means rethinking who makes decisions, how they are made, and how quickly they are acted upon. We detail four fundamental shifts toward an AI-driven strategy function with supporting examples from leading companies. 1. Build technology and data infrastructure bespoke to strategy.Strategy has lagged in digital technology adoption compared to functions like finance or operations. Classic strategic activities like competitive analysis and opportunity search remain analog, with critical data still siloed. This slows the generation of insights and limits the quality and timeliness of strategic decisions.Discover essential resources to master AI strategy and transform your business.AI fundamentally changes that. It gives strategists a substantially more powerful toolkit to generate insights tailored to specific problems, connecting signals scattered across systems and functions, and leveraging uniquely useful natural language capabilities. This requires developing proprietary data flows and modeling approaches that can become a source of competitive advantage. Organizations start by integrating information systems, breaking down silos, and supplementing them with external data sources.The luxury retail conglomerate LVMH illustrates how companies can begin to make this transformation. The company’s operating model is designed to provide group-level support to its more than 75 luxury brands while preserving their creative independence. The result was fragmentation across data and systems, making it difficult to apply AI at scale. Yet doing so became a strategic priority, to strengthen execution across the group and unlock opportunities brands couldn’t capture on their own.This was resolved by designing a centralized platform in partnership with Google Cloud, with a modular architecture bringing together internal ERP and CRM data without forcing uniformity. The company launched an AI factory to develop customizable algorithms deployed across the group. This allowed it to scale tools like a generative AI assistant to more than 40,000 employees, while enabling brands to apply AI in ways consistent with its own structure and needs.The application of AI across operations and strategy promoted cross-brand learning and visibility into previously siloed insights. LVMH’s AI assistant handles more than 2 million employee queries a month, speeding access to internal knowledge and building a shared base for future strategy decisions. Brands like Dior use predictive tools to refine customer engagement. Corporate teams apply AI to support strategic initiatives such as repositioning toward ultra-luxury, protecting margins through dynamic pricing, and safeguarding brand value through supply chain and anti-counterfeiting efforts.2. Make strategy a dynamic and distributed capability.AI is transforming how companies make decisions, shifting from static planning cycles to systems that adapt continuously. Instead of relying on episodic reviews, organizations are building decision-making models that respond to real-time conditions, using AI to detect signals and trigger action closer to the front lines.This shift depends on feedback loops where insights and recommendations are generated in real time, with AI agents helping teams simulate scenarios, gener",
