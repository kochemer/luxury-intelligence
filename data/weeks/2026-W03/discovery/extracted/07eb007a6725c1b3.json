As the Founder and CEO of The Clear Cut, this 4th generation diamond expert and Forbes 30 Under 30 honoree is transforming how consumers discover, purchase, and experience diamond jewelry.From Blog to Breakthrough: The Clear Cut's Origin StoryWhat started as an educational blog in 2016 has evolved into a multi-million dollar direct-to-consumer diamond jewelry company. Landau's journey began when friends and family started seeking her advice about purchasing engagement rings, leading her to create content that would demystify the traditionally opaque diamond buying process.The timing couldn't have been more perfect. The Clear Cut just closed their strongest Q1 since 2022, with engagement ring sales up 50% year-over-year in February–March 2025 and average order value increasing by 42%. This impressive growth underscores the market's hunger for transparency and personalization in luxury retail.Meet Eunice: The AI Engine Redefining Retail IntelligenceThe crown jewel of The Clear Cut's innovation is Eunice - a proprietary AI platform named after Eunice Miles, the first female gemologist. This isn't just another retail AI tool; it's a comprehensive intelligence system that's revolutionizing how luxury goods are priced, sourced, and sold.Eunice's Advanced Capabilities:Dynamic Pricing Intelligence: Analyzes vendor pricing patterns across the entire diamond market, breaking down the traditional \"this is the price\" model that has dominated the industry for decadesGranular Regional Analytics: Tracks customer trends across specific U.S. regions and neighborhoods—for example, identifying that SoHo and TriBeCa customers prefer 2.2 carat cushion-cut diamonds (58% preference rate) at an average price of $38,600Predictive Trend Analysis: Discovered the consumer shift toward elongated cushion-cut diamonds with specific length-to-width ratios between 1.3 and 1.5External Data Integration: Pulls insights from multiple online marketplaces to validate internal analysis and identify market inefficienciesInventory Gap Detection: Helps manufacturers understand what should be cut from rough diamonds based on real demand data rather than guessworkThe Business Impact:Eunice soft-launched in Q1 2025 and officially debuted in May, contributing directly to The Clear Cut's strongest quarter since 2022. The results speak to the power of AI-driven retail intelligence:50% year-over-year increase in engagement ring sales (February-March 2025)42% increase in average order valueAverage engagement ring value now exceeds $30,000As Kyle Simon, Co-founder and COO, explains: \"Now, we're able to actually analyze what is trending—a variety of factors like what sold many years ago, what's not selling, what are vendors doing across the market.\" This level of market intelligence transforms diamond retail from an intuition-based business to a data-driven science.Industry Recognition and Thought LeadershipLandau's expertise and innovative approach haven't gone unnoticed by industry leaders. She was recently featured at the WFDB Presidents Meeting 2025 in New York, where she shared insights on the future of the diamond industry with global leaders and stakeholders.Her recognition extends beyond industry circles: Landau has been recognized on the Forbes 30 Under 30 and Entrepreneur's 2021 100 Women of Impact list, with The Clear Cut being featured in Forbes, Vogue, Business Insider, TechCrunch, The New York Times and others.The Partnership That Built an EmpireThe Clear Cut's success story is also a love story. Landau met her co-founder and husband, Kyle Simon, while both were studying at the Gemological Institute of America (GIA). Simon, also a Forbes 30 Under 30 honoree and GIA Diamonds Graduate, previously co-founded a fair-trade diamond mining company in Sierra Leone before joining forces with Landau.Their complementary skill sets have been crucial to the company's growth. As Landau notes in interviews, while she focuses on product, customer experience, design, and social media, Simon handles the business operations, finance, and strategic planning - a division that has allowed them to scale efficiently while maintaining their white-glove service approach.Looking Ahead: Shoptalk Fall 2025 and BeyondThe retail world will have the opportunity to learn from Landau's expertise when she takes the stage at Shoptalk Fall 2025 in Chicago (September 17-19). She'll be participating in the highly anticipated retail AI panel: \"Retail Intelligence: What AI Can – and Can't – Do Today\" - a topic she's uniquely positioned to address given her real-world experience implementing AI at scale in luxury retail.This speaking engagement comes at a pivotal moment for re",
