  "extractedText": "Hello, my name is Caroline Goulard. I founded two companies in the field of data visualization, and for over ten years, I have been working to bridge the gap between humans and data. I’m delighted to be here with you for a new episode of The Bridge, Artefact’s media platform that explores artificial intelligence and its accessibility for everyone. Today, I’m joined by Edouard de Mézerac. Edouard, welcome! Could you introduce yourself?Hello! I’m very happy to be here today. My name is Edouard de Mézerac, and I joined Artefact in 2018. At that time, I was living in Shanghai, China, where I was already witnessing the early rise of data as a key driver of transformation. I remember my parents questioning my decision to join a new company from scratch, asking why I was taking such a risk. I had a cover of The Economist from April 2018 that read, « AI Will Disrupt Everything. » That moment reinforced my belief that something significant was happening, and I was drawn to the idea of joining a company fully dedicated to data and AI, especially to launch its activities in China. I spent four years growing Artefact’s business in Shanghai until 2022, then moved to Singapore for a short period. In total, I spent eight years in Asia before recently returning to Paris to take on a more global role at Artefact. Now that our teams across Asia have grown, I’m excited to be back in Paris and France.What is your personal experience with data and AI in the luxury industry?At Artefact, I currently lead our industry practices. Until now, our organization was primarily structured by country, but we felt the need for consistency and strong thought leadership within specific industries. As a result, we now have dedicated industry practices, including financial services, industrials, and, of course, luxury and beauty.I have spent considerable time working in the luxury sector. Over the past eight years, we have collaborated with nearly all major luxury groups across China, the US, and Europe, giving us a holistic view of the industry.The luxury market experiences constant fluctuations, often driven by overreactions. If we had this conversation three weeks ago, the atmosphere would have been quite gloomy. However, last week, a major luxury group published its Q4 2024 results, announcing a 10% year-on-year revenue increase. This surprised many, leading to a surge in stock prices across the luxury sector. This is a clear example of how the market tends to overreact to short-term changes.In reality, 2024 has been a challenging year, especially in China. The Chinese luxury market declined by 20%, which is a drastic drop. However, when we analyze Chinese luxury buyers as a whole—including those purchasing abroad—the decrease is only around 7-8%. This is because a significant share of luxury purchases by Chinese consumers now occurs outside China.For example, Japan saw a major boost in luxury sales due to currency fluctuations. The Japanese yen weakened against the Chinese renminbi, creating a price gap of around 30%. As a result, Chinese tourists flocked to Japan to buy luxury goods at significantly lower prices. This shows how complex and nuanced the luxury market in China can be.Beyond China, the US remains a key market for luxury. The current trend is positive, with expectations of at least 5% year-on-year growth in the coming years. While China may no longer be the primary growth engine for luxury brands, the US is poised to take on a more significant role.What is the current data and AI maturity of luxury companies based on your own observations?Luxury brands are well-positioned to leverage data effectively. Most luxury brands operate on a direct-to-consumer model, meaning they have detailed information about their customers. Unlike industries such as consumer packaged goods, where brands rely on intermediaries and have limited consumer data, luxury brands can track and analyze customer behavior in great detail.We recently conducted a study using public data from LinkedIn to assess the data maturity of luxury companies. We analyzed the number and types of data-related roles in these organizations. A few key takeaways emerged. All luxury brands have significantly increased their data teams, with some having hundreds or even thousands of data professionals. However, there are major differences between companies. Some have heavily invested in data, while others lag behind. For instance, LVMH leads in data talent, with a high ratio of data professionals to total employees. Other groups, such as Gucci, Chanel, and Hermès, have a significantly lower proportion of data talent.One key challenge is the shortage of product owners—the professionals responsible for translating business needs into data-driven solutions. Many luxury brands lack these roles, which creates a disconnect between data teams and business objectives. The most mature companies have structured product owner teams by brand or category to ensure alignment between data initia",
