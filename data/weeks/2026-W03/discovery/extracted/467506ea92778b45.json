Burberry’s AI and Technology: An Overview For years, Burberry has been at the forefront of technology and AI. In 2006, the British luxury brand started reinventing itself as an end-to-end digital enterprise, using AI and data to increase sales and customer satisfaction. From using Snapchat’s Snapcode feature to launching a dedicated channel on Apple Music, to using AI for product development and production, too, Burberry has always been a tech-led luxury brand. Burberry’s AI shopping experience: A breakdown of AI strategies From machine learning (ML) to automation, and augmented reality (AR) to virtual image recognition, AI technologies offer various ways to enhance online shopping for customers. Alongside, AI also helps brands improve performance, drive conversions, and stay ahead in the competitive digital commerce market. Here are 11 lessons from Burberry’s AI shopping experience. 1. Augmented Reality Burberry has implemented augmented reality (AR) in its shopping experience. Customers can visualize products in 3D format before making purchases. This not only makes the online shopping experience more interesting and interactive, it also removes doubts and uncertainty that are often a part of online shopping. For example, with the AR technology, customers can see how a Burberry blazer looks on them or view the details of a handbag’s buckle. How has this helped the brand? Increased engagement metrics Reduced product returns Customers make decisions easily Reduced environmental impact because of fewer returns Improved customer satisfaction 2. Social Features Burberry has partnered with WeChat for its social retail strategy. The app helps the brand create integrated online and offline shopping experiences. The brand uses WeChat programs for marketing, loyalty rewards, and in-store interactions, such as providing product information, booking appointments, access exclusive content personalized for them, and accessing limited-edition collections. This feature transforms transactional experiences into engaging shopping journeys. Moreover, AI algorithms continuously improve its understanding of customers to deliver more personalized and relevant content. 3. Gamification Burberry has implemented an intelligent social currency system, a rewards framework. It tracks customers’ engagement online and offline (in store). For example, it tracks when customers are engaging with the brand on Instagram, on the website, or visiting their store. The AI-powered system collects all the data, and creates a unified customer profile that helps with personalization based on individual customer behavior patterns. This feature drives ongoing engagement. Here’s what the AI-based system does: Recognizes loyalty customers based on their purchase patterns Identifies frequent browsers Observes customers’ style preferences Automatically adjusts rewards Creates personalized experiences 4. Conversational Commerce Burberry’s AI chatbots on its social platforms, particularly on Facebook Messenger. This helps the brand constantly stay in touch with customers. The AI chatbot uses natural language processing and machine learning (ML) to provide personalized assistance to customers. Here’s how it helps Burberry’s AI shopping experience: Sends notification about new arrivals that match their style preferences Offer styling advice based on previous purchases Schedule appointments at Burberry stores Answer queries about products, etc. Help with transactions and payment related queries 5.
