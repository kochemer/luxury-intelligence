It can when it focuses on improving how customers discover products, receive support, and engage with the brand. But GenAI can’t progress beyond possibilities, plans, and proof of concept without concrete objectives driven by cloud and pipeline-as-code infrastructure. This is the only way to support real business outcomes that enhance customer experience, marketing, and competitiveness and improve margins. Your retail enterprise can move beyond isolated AI experiments or one-off pilot tools to repeatable processes that turn AI into operational capability at scale. GenAI is already helping the largest retailers put customers first while maintaining a competitive edge: For example, Walmart introduced a GenAI-based chatbot in June 2025. This type of approach, when built on a cloud foundation designed for retail, is the key to achieving generative AI success in any retail enterprise. Generative AI can only be the new retail imperative when you know what’s possible. In this article, we’ll explore concrete GenAI use cases for retailers and provide foundational tips for planning and implementation. By the end, you’ll have a clear sense of how to leverage generative AI to maximize innovation and value. How Generative AI Enhances the Retail Customer Experience As a retailer, you’re already focused on scaling personalization and delivering digital experiences that adapt to customers’ needs in real time. Generative AI can help you accelerate and further personalize this process. According to AI-powered mobile marketing leader Attentive’s global survey, 96% of consumers report they are more likely to make a purchase when a brand delivers personalized messages. The two biggest opportunities are producing content and facilitating interactions that reflect customer intent, behavior, and context. CX and marketing have always relied on a creative layer that comes with scalability, customization, and delivery bottlenecks. Generative AI can eliminate these bottlenecks when the retailer is prepared with: Clean and structured product data Clear voice and brand messaging frameworks Cloud infrastructure capable of handling fluctuating needs and markets Governance processes to monitor output quality and compliance GenAI enables you to create and adapt messages, product descriptions, guidance text, and conversation flows dynamically. It can also scale your creative output without diluting your brand’s voice. The challenge is always on the input side. You need to build every experience on consistent data/data strategies, well-defined workflows, and stable infrastructure. Next, let’s look at specific examples of what’s possible and what it takes to get there. Product Descriptions at Scale The most prominent use cases for generative AI in retail focus on how customers discover, evaluate, and select products. You’re already spending a lot of effort creating product detail pages, style guides, category descriptions, and promotional stories. The sheer volume of required content makes it difficult to maintain brand equity, but GenAI allows you to: Generate and scale clear and interesting product descriptions with individual attributes, materials, and features Reduce time to market Drive consistent quality and uniform messaging across global catalog product launches, ensuring alignment with cultural, language, and retail platform norms Give creative teams the control to focus on storytelling, campaigns, brand experience, and performance analysis rather than production workflows Cut creative costs while keeping catalogs fresh and aligned with inventory Improve publishing speed and reduce delays between inventory arrival and online availability It all starts with the right foundation of cloud, data, and infrastructure to make the most of AI. You can then create product description pathways that improve CX and minimize returns. Personalized Marketing Content The same logic applies to personalized marketing content. Generative AI can adapt messaging to reflect actual customer behavior rather than broad demographic segments, allowing your marketing messages to change based on customer intent rather than following pre-scheduled campaigns. Your marketing content can adapt based on what customers view, compare, and add or remove from carts, all of which affect the marketing content they see. (Even in-store purchases can shape this customization.) GenAI uses interaction patterns to improve messaging by: Analyzing browsing, purchase, and loyalty data to drive relevance for segment-based email, ad, and push copy Shifting messages based on what customers interact with to deliver creative messages that spur sales Understanding when and how to deliver the right message so customers feel supported, not annoyed The aim is to make personalization meaningful so that messages reflect genuine customer",
