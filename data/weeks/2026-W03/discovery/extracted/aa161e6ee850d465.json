A period of global market volatilities and record-high inflation is creating retail pricing’s most stubborn headache, occurring at the same time as its largest opportunity for advancement: Seismic leaps in AI, machine learning, and automation. After adjustments for inflation, only 52% of companies across 13 industries and 19 countries expect real revenue growth in 2023 – the lowest number in decades. In essence, retail and branded goods pricing today is a reflection of what is going on in the world. How are consumers and retail leaders alike dealing with and responding to these trends? How can brands and retailers keep their heads above water? In this article, we will discuss key trends affecting retail pricing, e-commerce, and consumer behaviour, and will offer vendors tried-and-tested pricing and commercial strategies. Market volatility: Inflation, food and gas increases, and consumer suffering For consumers and businesses alike, inflation seems to be the waterproof mascara of the retail industry – hanging on a little too long and doing its job a little too effectively. Europe began 2022 with 5.8% inflation in February, which only increased throughout the year to 9.1% in August. Simultaneously, the UK experienced a 40-year record-high of 10.1% inflation in mid-2022, while in the US, the average inflation rate sat at 6.5% for the year. Even as we enter the second half of 2023, retail pricing is still feeling the effects as brands and retailers maintain higher prices to offset the cost of inflation. Gas prices in Europe increased by 150% between July 2021 - 2022, while food costs are sitting 17% higher in April 2023 versus the year earlier. In Germany alone, cheese increased by 40%, according to the country’s Federal Statistical Office. As food and energy costs remain high and barely manageable, consumer suffering has resulted in more conservative spending and a shift to less expensive brands. Most notably, high- and low-income households are both cutting down on spending, with spending growth from high-income shoppers sitting at -3% for two months in a row, May and June, for the first time in two years.

This change in consumer behaviour, coupled with stubborn inflation, has created a deadlock for retail pricing beyond food. Brands and retailers can’t afford to decrease prices without suffering significant losses. At the same time, consumers aren’t able to maintain the same spending habits they were used to before inflation became a consistent reality in the shopping cart. Consequently, brands and retailers need to react in creative ways to fuel growth and stay profitable. For this, we have identified three levers to succeed under these difficult market circumstances.

Pricing Innovation: Digitalisation of pricing and the development of dynamic competition Dynamic pricing is not as established as the industry of pricing itself. Set pricing without haggling or bargaining first occurred in the late 1800s when a shop owner, John Wanamaker, placed a price tag on an item in Philadelphia, USA. Implementing a pricing strategy and tracking price changes has largely been a manual task with some form of a digital blueprint or spreadsheet to keep track. Today, the convergence of the availability of large data volumes at a decent quality, fast computer processing power, and, ultimately, advanced analytics and AI have made it possible to apply dynamic pricing automatically at high speed. Today, dynamic pricing is not just used in airlines or hotels but also in e-commerce and online retail. According to a June 2023 study conducted by Horváth, using digitalisation to boost efficiency in areas like pricing processes was at the top of the list of industry-specific needs, with 55% agreeing that it would have a high impact, showing just how effective dynamic pricing has become. In addition, Horváth found that 30% agreed that implementing AI in business rules would also have a high impact. There are various pricing strategies brands can implement to improve profits, increase market share, and strengthen customer relationships. The beauty of dynamic pricing is that it can bring together all these different strategies at once w",
