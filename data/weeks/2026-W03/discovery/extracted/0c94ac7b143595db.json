Shoppers crave the kind of deeply personal experiences that artificial intelligence makes possible, yet they’re cautious about how much data they share. Once loyalty was all about collecting points or signing up for discounts; now it's something more emotional. People don’t want to be sold to in the same way. They want to feel known, understood and valued. They want to buy from brands that see them as individuals rather than data points. They want early drops and unique experiences that make them feel special. For brands, this opens up a chance to rethink what loyalty looks like, using AI to anticipate needs, build trust, and create lasting relationships. AI as an Attention Giver What AI does so well is help brands listen more closely. It spots the small clues that people leave behind when they browse, buy or engage online, and turns them into insight and intelligence. That might mean recognizing when someone is about to lose interest or predicting what they might want next. Brands like SKIMS and LuisaViaRoma are already using smart customer retention tactics through their loyalty programs. And in an industry where trends move fast, being able to respond quickly and personally is essential for keeping consumers captivated. In fact, 87.7 percent of surveyed retail executives think micro-targeting has a positive impact on customer retention and satisfaction. It’s this prediction that AI does best. It takes patterns that would be impossible for humans to see and uses them to anticipate behavior. If a businessperson regularly buys a new suit every few months, AI can sense when they're likely to start looking again and send a well-timed reminder or suggestion that can make the difference between a lost sale and a returning customer. The result feels less like being sold to and more like being helped by a friendly assistant. That’s the mindset we need. The beauty of AI is that it allows personalization at scale. It’s not mass marketing or even traditional segmentation categories. We’ve gone beyond female 25-35. Instead of broad segments, it can create thousands of tiny ones. A newsletter can show different content to each reader; a homepage can adapt to what someone has viewed before; even the tone of a message can shift to match a customer’s style. These changes might seem small, but together they build a sense that a brand is paying attention. And our data shows people want it: 39.6 percent of consumers are more likely to join a loyalty program that uses AI to improve their experience, showing a clear appetite for this kind of intelligent interaction when it provides real value. Trust as the Foundation of Loyalty When recommendations feel relevant rather than random or salesy, people are more open to hearing from a brand again. They trust that you’re on their side and it’s a team effort. It’s this trust that turns convenience into connection, and is the foundation of loyalty. Once that feeling of connection is there, loyalty starts to grow naturally. Customers come back, engage more deeply and share their positive experiences. It becomes a habit rather than a decision. They always shop with you. And AI can even help strengthen that habit through gentle nudges and reminders. Maybe a note that their favorite items are nearly back in stock, or an invitation to an exclusive preview. Done right, it feels like a friend keeping you in the loop of something you want to know more about. Data + Tech + Human Underpinning all of this is data. For AI to work well, the data has to be clean, consistent and connected. If customer information is scattered across systems or out-of-date, then even the smartest algorithm will struggle. The result can be clumsy messaging that does the opposite of building loyalty — out of touch, tone deaf, frustratingly clunky. Brands that want to use AI effectively need to invest in the basics first. It's also worth remembering that as excited as we all are in the industry, AI is only a tool. Technology can guide and enhance but it cannot replace genuine brand personality and effective marketing. Customers can sense when messages are robotic or forced. Human voice still matters. The most effective use of AI is when it supports creativity, freeing people to focus on storytelling, ideas and empathy. Brands and retailers shouldn’t be rushing to replace their teams any time soon, but rather working with them and allowing AI to augment what they do, with the customer always the focus. In the end, I don’t think AI will reinvent loyalty so much as reimagine how it feels for consumers. It’s always been about trust. The technology makes it possible to understand people in more human",
