AI agent traffic surged 805% year-over-year on Black Friday 2025, and $67 billion in Cyber Week sales were influenced by AI agents. For fashion and lifestyle brands, the question is no longer whether to prepare for AI-first shopping, but how quickly you can adapt.TL;DR: AI agents now influence 20% of all e-commerce orders. Fashion leaders like SKIMS, Glossier, and Vuori are already live on ChatGPT Instant Checkout. Retailers must choose between ACP and AP2 protocols, optimize catalogs for AI discovery, and act before the 2026 inflection point when Forrester predicts one-quarter of shoppers will use retail chatbots.Why Should Fashion Retailers Care About AI Commerce?AI commerce represents the fastest-growing channel in retail history. According to Salesforce, retailers with AI agents achieved 13% sales growth during Cyber Week 2025, while those without managed only 2%, a 7x performance advantage.Fashion-specific data is compelling:50% of consumers trust AI more than friends for fashion advice (Bloomreach)SKIMS, Glossier, Spanx, and Vuori are live on ChatGPT Instant CheckoutTarget launched multi-item shopping with fresh food and drive-up fulfillmentThe stakes are clear: SAP Emarsys declared that \"2025 will likely be the last year consumers shop as they do now.\"What Protocols Should Fashion Brands Support?Two competing protocols dominate the agentic commerce landscape.

Glossier, SKIMS, Spanx, and Vuori already process transactions through ChatGPT Instant Checkout using ACP.

With 60+ partners including Mastercard, PayPal, American Express, and Adobe, AP2 focuses on authorization, traceability, and audit controls across the payments ecosystem.Strategic recommendation: Support both protocols. Protocol fragmentation is real, and fashion brands need presence across ChatGPT (ACP), Google (AP2), and emerging platforms.How Should You Optimize Catalogs for AI Discovery?AI agents behave differently than human shoppers. According to HUMAN Security, 87% of agent requests target product pages directly. Optimization requires structured data that machines can parse instantly.Essential catalog optimizations:Rich product descriptions with material, fit, and care informationComprehensive size guides in machine-readable formatsHigh-quality images with descriptive alt textSchema markup for AI comprehensionInventory and pricing feeds updated in real-timeFor lifestyle brands, aesthetic storytelling matters.
