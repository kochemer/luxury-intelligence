It will grow from $1.26 billion in 2024 to $1.77 billion in 2025 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 40.4%. The growth in the historic period can be attributed to visual search and recognition, supply chain optimization, virtual try-on solutions, fraud detection, sustainable practices. The AI in fashion market size is expected to see exponential growth in the next few years. It will grow to $6.99 billion in 2029 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 41%. The growth in the forecast period can be attributed to voice-activated shopping, predictive trend analysis, dynamic pricing strategies. Major trends in the forecast period include virtual try-on experience, personalized recommendations, computer vision for style recognition, supply chain optimization, chatbots and virtual assistants.The burgeoning impact of social media within the fashion industry stands as a catalyst for the expansion of AI in the fashion market. Social media has evolved into a crucial information hub for the fashion sector, offering a plethora of opinions and global insights. Present-day fashion heavily relies on brand promotion and endorsements by fashion influencers who leverage social media platforms to communicate their perspectives on trends. For instance, data from influencer marketing hub indicates a substantial growth in the influencer marketing market, soaring from $9.7 billion in 2020 to $13.8 billion in 2021. The rise in popularity of short video formats on platforms such as TikTok, Facebook, and YouTube, coupled with the pandemic-induced surge in social media consumption, has significantly contributed to this trend. Additionally, marketers' increased utilization of data collection for social media advertising optimization further fuels this growth. The escalating influence of social media thus continues to propel the advancement of AI in the fashion market.The burgeoning penetration of e-commerce is a significant driver behind the growth of the AI in the fashion market. E-commerce, or electronic commerce, involves the online buying and selling of goods and services. The expanding landscape of e-commerce has propelled the necessity for artificial intelligence (AI) in the fashion industry. Online retailers utilize AI algorithms to deliver personalized shopping experiences, optimize product search results, and elevate customer engagement and loyalty. For example, data from The United States Census Bureau in November 2023 indicates a 7.6% increase (±1.2%) in e-commerce estimates for Q3 2023 compared to Q3 2022, with e-commerce sales accounting for 15.6% of total sales in the third quarter of 2023. Hence, the escalating penetration of e-commerce serves as a driving force behind the growth of AI adoption within the fashion market.Major companies in the AI fashion market are concentrating on developing machine learning technologies, such as AI platforms, to enhance personalization, optimize inventory, and streamline supply chains. These advancements aim to improve customer experience and promote sustainability within the industry. An AI platform serves as a comprehensive environment that offers tools and resources for the development, deployment, and management of artificial intelligence applications. It generally includes development frameworks, data management, computational resources, and deployment services. For example, in October 2023, Mango, a Spain-based outlet store company, launched Lisa, its conversational generative AI platform. This platform streamlines processes and enhances user experience by providing instant support for design, trend analysis, and customer service. It acts as a co-pilot for employees, fostering efficiency and innovation as part of the company's digital transformation strategy.Major players in the AI in fashion sector are actively engaged in pioneering technologies, particularly virtual try-on tools. These digital innovations enable users to virtually experience or try on products, primarily within the realm of online shopping. For example, in June 2023, Google LLC, a leading technology company headquartered in the USA, unveiled the 'AI Try-On' platform. This platform allows customers to engage with products marked with a 'Try On' badge, offering the ability to virtually visualize how tops from renowned brands such as H&M, Loft, Everlane, and Anthropologie would appear on different models. This cutting-edge technology serves as a visual aid for consumers, facilitating the envisioning of clothing on individuals with diverse characteristics, encompassing various sizes (ranging from XXS to 4XL), skin tones, body shapes, and hair types.In July 2024, Hi-Tech Apparel, a manufacturing company based in Thailand, acquired Unmade for an undisclosed amount. Through this acquisition, Hi-Tech Apparel intends to establish a digital-first, sustainable manufacturing model that improves customization and responsiveness to market demands",
