Amazon recently introduced “Buy for Me,” a shopping agent that can search, compare, and complete purchases across Amazon and third-party sites. OpenAI has integrated agentic shopping into ChatGPT, allowing users to buy directly from partners like Etsy and soon Shopify, positioning its assistant as both a conversational tool and a transactional one. Together, these moves show that both companies view autonomous shopping agents as a central part of the future of e-commerce.With SMPL-powered agents, shopping moves from a passive search and click process to an autonomous goal driven process where technology acts on behalf of the consumer. Instead of navigating product pages or managing multiple checkouts, customers define intent and the agent handles the rest, searching, comparing, deciding, and completing transactions across platforms. These agents can reduce one of retail’s biggest problems, product returns. By analyzing body measurements, past purchases, sizing charts, and brand specific fit data, SMPL agents help shoppers find the correct fit before buying, making returns less likely. The outcome is lower costs for retailers, who spend billions annually on reverse logistics and lost resale value, and reduced environmental harm, with millions of tons of CO₂ emissions and waste generated each year from returned goods. This represents a significant transformation of retail into an efficient and sustainable system where commerce is personalized and proactive.So, what is SMPL?SMPL, short for Skinned Multi-Person Linear model, is a parametric 3D human body model that has become the standard for representing digital humans in computer vision. Instead of storing thousands of separate body scans, SMPL compresses human variation into two sets of parameters: shape, which defines body proportions such as height, weight, or muscularity, and pose, which defines how joints move and rotate in 3D space. With these inputs, SMPL generates a mesh of the body that deforms naturally using a technique called linear blend skinning, the same method used in video games and animation to make characters move smoothly. The model was trained on thousands of high-resolution body scans, so it captures both detailed shape variation and natural movement. This makes SMPL useful for applications in film, AR and VR avatars, motion capture, fitness, sports analysis, and fashion technology. Extensions such as SMPL X expand the model to include detailed hand poses and facial expressions, while variants such as STAR allow faster real-time performance. SMPL functions as a digital template of the human body that can be scaled, posed, and adapted for research, design, or commerce.SMPL model with joint regression, where each joint position is estimated as a weighted combination of surrounding vertices.

At its foundation, it represents a person as a 3D mesh, a set of points connected into triangles that can be reshaped and posed. To capture the diversity of human bodies, SMPL uses shape parameters (β), a small set of numbers that adjust features such as height, weight, muscle tone, and proportions. These parameters were learned by analyzing thousands of 3D scans and compressing them into a compact representation of human variation. Once the body shape is defined, pose parameters (θ) control the rotation of each joint in the skeleton. This allows the mesh to be animated in different positions, with 72 values covering the major joints of the body. To make these movements smooth, SMPL applies Linear Blend Skinning, a technique where each point on the mesh is influenced by nearby joints, ensuring realistic bending and stretching instead of distortions. SMPL also includes blend shapes, which are learned deformations that model the natural effects of motion on muscles and skin, such as shoulders moving when arms are raised. These elements together transform a set of parameters into a 3D human body that can be customized for different uses.SMPL is a model that requires input from real-world data. Sensing and capture technologies provide this input. LiDAR, photogrammetry, and computer vision each offer methods for collecting information about the human body, which can then be translated into SMPL’s shape and pose parameters. Depending on the application, one method may be more suitable than another. LiDAR provides centimeter-level accuracy for medica",
