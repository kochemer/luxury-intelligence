With technology continuing to evolve and scale, it’s no surprise that the use cases are being applied to all sectors. Businesses are beginning to see the impacts that generative AI can have on optimizing their operations and are seizing the opportunity, with Walmart taking point in this new wave of technology adoption.What Is Generative AI? Generative AI, one of the hottest topics in tech, earned recognition as 2023’s \"Word of the Year\" by Collins Dictionary. But what exactly is it? Generative AI refers to advanced technology capable of creating new content—text, images, or even code—by identifying patterns in massive datasets. This technology uses machine learning models to analyze data, learn from it, and produce human-like outputs.From ChatGPT to MidJourney, generative AI tools are already transforming workflows worldwide. According to McKinsey, these applications could generate up to $4.4 trillion annually for the global economy. The message is clear: generative AI is not just a buzzword but a pivotal force shaping the future of industries like ecommerce.Walmart’s Generative AI Strategy The new wave of technological advancement is not only taking over traditional software spaces, but significantly impacting all industry sectors, including ecommerce. Generative AI applications in the retail and consumer goods sector are projected to see a potential rise in annual revenue by $400-$660 billion. With automated key functions like marketing, customer service, sales, inventory, and supply chain management, the implementation of generative AI is quickly gaining traction across all divisions. Embracing Adaptive Retail with Generative AIWalmart is one of the leading retailers embracing generative AI as a core part of its business strategy to step confidently into the new digital era they’ve coined “adaptive retail”. This new strategy focuses on leveraging technology to meet consumers where they readily spend their time - online and engaging across multiple platforms. As part of this strategy, Walmart has shifted its focus to engage the next generation of customers on gaming platforms, partnering with Roblox to reach over 80 million daily users and solidify its presence in trending digital spaces. Walmart has created an online community and virtual shopping experience, “Walmart Discovered”, where users can explore trending items and creators, virtually shop products and create their own departments within Walmart’s digital storefront, using Roblox’s currency, Robux.Wallaby: Walmart’s Proprietary AI ModelComplementing this approach, Walmart has even developed their own large language model (LLM), Wallaby, a retail-specific algorithm to work alongside other LLMs in creating a cohesive, customized retail experience. Trained off of Walmart's proprietary data, the LLM can predict the customer’s needs and tailor their experience aligning with customer behaviors, all while maintaining Walmart’s branded tone and voice. AI-Powered Customer SupportOne example of Walmart’s AI advancements is their new AI-powered customer support chatbot. The generative AI tool empowers customers in their support journey. The new chatbot is designed to not only guide consumers through their customer experience, but take action as well, such as order cancellations or processing refunds. The company designed the chatbot to give customers autonomy when seeking swift support. As Walmart’s CTO & CDO, Suresh Kumar states “A standard search bar is no longer the fastest path to purchase, rather we must use technology to adapt to customers’ individual preferences and needs”. Walmart’s commitment to adaptation has been proven to pay off, with personalized experiences shown to increase customer engagement and satisfaction by 20% and reducing marketing and sales costs by 10-20%, positively impacting the company’s bottom line.Creating a Personalized Shopping ExperienceWalmart is a leader in offering a personalized shopping experience. By leveraging generative AI, the company is customizing online homepages for each customer, showcasing products and content most relevant to them. This tailored approach mimics an in-store shopping experience, making the online platform feel like their own personalized Walmart. Through generative AI, Walmart is anticipating the types of content customers want to see, further personalizing their experience, and fostering a deeper understanding of their preferences to enhance their shopping journey. ‍‍Streamlining Internal Processes with AI ToolsBeyond the customer experience, Walmart is leveraging AI to optimize internal operations for both in-store associates and corporate employees.
