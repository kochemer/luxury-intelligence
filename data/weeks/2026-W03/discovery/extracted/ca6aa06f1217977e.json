The office lights dimmed when I powered up my computer. So, I sympathize with today’s category managers who are still mired in spreadsheets or outdated planning systems. Inaccuracies and inefficiencies are baked into the very processes they use to manage their retail pricing strategies. These processes can’t handle the requirements and scale of retail data analysis, no matter how heroically teams maintain their files. The good news is that pricing solutions have advanced far beyond formulas and data tables teetering on the edge of breaking every time someone uses the office microwave. AI-driven retail price optimization solutions now integrate, process, and analyze data from across the organization in near real-time. This level of visibility and control gives retailers the rapid insights they need to effectively manage pricing decisions across locations, categories, and banners – every week. Let’s explore how the right solution helps companies determine and execute optimal retail pricing strategies that protect margins, maintain a competitive price image, and increase customer satisfaction. Types of retail pricing strategies A pricing strategy determines how a product will be priced to achieve a particular KPI. Before we talk about implementing a strategy, let’s consider our options. There are five standard retail pricing strategies. Preserving the status quo: Often, for main stake products, retailers prefer to maintain revenue and margin levels. They’re not looking to make big changes that could upset the balance of demand for that product. Gaining incremental margin wins: In the convenience category, retailers may risk slightly wider margins, but they keep that risk to a minimum to avoid alienating customers. Maximizing margins: Your margin enhancers are products that allow you to significantly improve margins without negatively affecting demand or price image. Protecting your territory: In some cases, it’s worth pricing certain products somewhat aggressively, even to the slight detriment of your margins, if it means gaining an edge over the competition. Staying competitive – even if it costs you: Sometimes, competitors offer such low prices on specific items, you need to match them just to get customers through the door. Highly aggressive pricing may significantly shrink your margin on that product, but it’s worth it to protect your price image and increase traffic. So now you have an array of strategies. How do you decide which strategy to apply to each product? The challenges of selecting a strategy and the dangers of getting it wrong There’s a lot at stake when designing a retail strategy. A poor strategy can create inventory inefficiencies, erode margins, reduce your competitiveness, and damage customer trust. You’ll have to wade through a lot of considerations and data before you can determine which pricing strategy best fits each product, category, location, and season. Fig. 1: When developing pricing strategies, retailers must balance factors like price elasticity, price image, and competitor activities, often while contending with disruptions and internal issues like large datasets and asynchronous planning. Data, data everywhere, but we don’t know what to think To determine the impact pricing decisions have on demand, retailers must gather enormous volumes of data from multiple sources and then store, process, and analyze that data to make effective decisions. Plus, as a retailer, you may have 100 categories, multiplied by five banners, available in five different pricing regions. That’s a lot of input to analyze, often on a very tight schedule. Most planning processes cannot handle and organize this flow of information at the rate the industry moves. Without a system that creates a cohesive picture of data at a granular, product-specific level, retailers won’t have the insights and visibility to plan efficiently, meet demand, and achieve margin targets. Determining price elasticity Price elasticity refers to how drastically changes in price affect demand – a key consideration when devising a strategy. Products that experience significant demand fluctuations in response to price changes are considered highly “elastic.” For example, if you put non-essential treats on sale – cookies, candy, chips – you’ll likely see a spike in demand as people stock up on their favorites. Other products – usually staples like bread or milk – are “inelastic.” Demand for these products remains the same, regardless of price. If you raise the price of milk, consumers will likely still pay it because they consider milk a necessity. If you run a promotion, it probably won’t make a significant difference, e",
