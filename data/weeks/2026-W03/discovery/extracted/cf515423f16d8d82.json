Having managed to line up the stop-and-start dates on our advisory work, we took a little monthlong break in our business in November - for travel, family time, and some creative projects (Connections on LinkedIn or Insta got a glimpse.) The break also gave us time to think. What about? About the commerce platform of the future. Will there even be such a thing? What will it need to do? Will that be different from the past and present? What can we learn from past decades and cycles? Maybe it’s not just one model of platform that will find success. Will this thaw the freeze in enterprise commerce platform investment and get the ice flowing downstream? Oh, and what’s a Perfect Martini?Cheers!If you are new to Cocktails & Commerce, welcome!

Gin - let’s ignore any talk of vodka for now - cut with vermouth in varying proportions stands as the literal symbol cocktailing for better or worse (See: 🍸). Indeed, no mixed drink has inspired so many poems, prose, jokes and iconic images as the Martini. Over close to two centuries, the Martini has graduated from cocktail spec to a signifier of cultural refinement - that is if it is a real one.A Stirred, Not Shaken, HistoryThe origin story of the Martini has been long sought after, much debated, and at times simply imagined. The most repeated origin story is that the Martini was born from the Martinez, a drink with gin and sweet-vermouth supposedly invented for a thirsty California gold-rush era miner on his way to the Sacramento River Delta port town of Martinez with a pocket full of gold nuggets. He supposedly saddled up the bar, dropped a crumb of gold on the mahogany and asked for something like, “Cold gin, cut with vermouth”. The problem is that the source of the Martinez story was an infant at the time… and certainly unlikely to have been imbibing next to a grizzled 49er at the bar. (A dream… What would Carl Jung say about that? Let’s not get distracted!)Drinks combining juniper‑based spirits with vermouth actually began surfacing well before then, in the early 1800’s. By 1883 they began appearing in newspapers around the U.S., but at that point the beverage was labeled a kind of “Manhattan” - a drink “lightened” with vermouth, but with jenever (the Dutch predecessor of gin) or Old Tom gin rather than whiskey. In the following years, drinks with names such as “Martine”, “Martineau”, “Marteni”, and “Martingny” were regularly ordered across the noisy bars of New York’s clubland - the variations no doubt caused by overhearing the name through the cacophony of a dark club (Party like it’s 1889!).By the 1890’s, The Martini had established itself as the gin-based cousin of the Manhattan, and name stuck - no doubt helped by the name of the dominant vermouth of the age, the Italian Martini & Rossi - which at the time, accounted for two-thirds of the vermouth imported into the United States. By the end of that decade the drink had become one of many important cocktails in every bartender’s arsenal, but hardly the dominant kingpin of cocktailing.The Martini’s Rise to Prominence Through NecessityIt was in the years of Prohibition (1920-1933) in the United States that the Martini began to coalesce into the icon we see it as today. During Prohibition, the Martini surged in popularity largely to make the widely-available, illicit, often homemade “bathtub gin” palatable. Unlike whiskey or rum, which required aging and were harder to produce (and store!) clandestinely, gin could be made quickly and in large quantities with little more than grain alcohol, some juniper and some herbs to macerate in the illicit gin - in a bathtub if need be. This raw, harsh spirit was inconsistent and not always great. It needed something to temper its bite. Aromatic, available, wine-based vermouth fit the bill perfectly.While Prohibition made the production, importation, and sale of all alcohol illegal in the U.S., vermouth - be",
