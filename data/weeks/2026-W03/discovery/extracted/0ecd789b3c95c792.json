The Deloitte Global Retail Outlook 2024 highlights how these pressures are reshaping the retail landscape. It urges leaders to rethink their strategies to maintain profitability while continuing to meet consumer demands.AI-powered business intelligence (BI) is a helpful tool for overcoming retail challenges. It can optimize operations, improve pricing strategies, and increase efficiency in a business. This article explores how AI-powered BI can help retailers:Manage inflationary pressuresReduce operational costsMaintain competitive margins in a challenging economic climateUnderstanding the economic landscape: Insights from Deloitte's Global Retail Outlook 2024The Deloitte Global Retail Outlook 2024 report clearly shows the economic problems retail leaders are currently facing. Inflation and rising costs are major issues for retailers, impacting supply chains, labor expenses, and how they set prices.As the report indicates, retailers are under increasing pressure to find innovative solutions. They also want answers that control costs effectively without sacrificing the quality of the customer experience.According to Deloitte, the retail sector is experiencing a period of \"cost consciousness.\" This means that controlling the cost of goods and services has become as critical as driving revenue. Retailers who don't change their business operations may lose money and customers and face financial problems in the future. However, those that leverage advanced technologies like AI-powered BI are better positioned to navigate these challenges effectively.The role of AI-powered business intelligence in managing inflation1. Optimizing pricing strategiesOne of the most immediate ways that inflation affects retailers is through pricing. As the cost of goods rises, so does the need to adjust prices accordingly. To avoid pushing away price-weary customers, businesses must carefully manage price increases and methods of data collection. AI tools can help stores improve pricing by analyzing data to balance profit and competitiveness.AI can process historical sales data, competitor pricing, market demand, and customer behavior to recommend optimal pricing points. For instance, merchandisers might offer targeted discounts to loyal customers. They could also attract new customers with introductory prices to encourage repeat purchases.This ensures that prices remain competitive while maximizing revenue.Moreover, AI-powered analytics can segment customers based on their price sensitivity, allowing retailers to personalize pricing and promotions. For instance, retailers might offer loyal customers targeted discounts. They could also attract new customers with introductory prices to encourage repeat purchases. By using AI to inform pricing strategies, retailers can mitigate the impact of inflation without compromising on customer satisfaction.2. Reducing operational costsOperational efficiency is another critical area where AI-powered BI can make a significant impact. The Deloitte report highlights the importance of streamlining operations to combat rising costs. AI can help retailers identify inefficiencies across their operations, from supply chain management to workforce allocation. Supply Chain Optimization: AI-powered BI tools can analyze supply chain data and the acquisition of raw materials. They can:Identify bottlenecksForecast demand more accuratelyOptimize inventory levelsThis reduces the risk of overstocking or stockouts, both costly. By improving supply chain efficiency, retailers can lower the cost of goods sold and reduce waste. This directly contributes to better margins.For example, predictive analytics can forecast demand by analyzing the following:Historical sales dataMarket trendsExternal factors, like weather patterns or economic shiftsThis allows retailers to adjust their inventory levels proactively, reducing the costs associated with excess inventory or emergency replenishment.Workforce management: Labor costs are another significant concern for retailers, particularly in an environment where wages are rising. AI-powered BI can help optimize workforce management.It does this by predicting peak times and ensuring that staffing levels match customer demand. This not only reduces labor costs. It also improves customer service by ensuring that the right number of employees are available when needed.For instance, AI can analyze foot traffic patterns in stores to predict busy periods and recommend optimal staffing schedules. This ensures that retailers have the right amount of staff during peak hours. This reduces the need for costly overtime or temporary workers while maintaining service quality.3.
