Here are the trends, strategies, and data you need to know in 2025. by Leah Levine Kaminsky / Michael KeenanThe platform built for future-proofingGet in touchThe fashion and apparel industry continues to demonstrate its dominant position in ecommerce. The sector has achieved a remarkable $781 billion market value—a number projected to more than double within six years. Still, fashion retailers face many macroeconomic headwinds. There are mixed signals on whether inflation is set to continue, but scarred consumers are still buying with caution. According to Ipsos's 2024 global consumer research, 32% of consumers across 29 countries still cite inflation as their primary worry. While major retailers initially responded with price increases, they've faced strong resistance from inflation-weary consumers prioritizing essential spending. The National Retail Federation reports that retailers' gross margins are actually lower now than during most of the pre-pandemic period, demonstrating that price increases were driven by rising input costs rather than profit-taking. Shifts in the demanded customer experience are also proving challenging, especially among younger consumers. Recent data from McKinsey shows over 75% of consumers are trading down their purchases for better value and pricing. When you zoom in to Gen Z and millennials, that number rises to 86%. This demographic increasingly craves sustainable retail—though reviews are mixed on whether they’re willing to pay for it. And they also want tech-enabled shopping, blending digital and physical retail environments. Fashion brands must now navigate these complex market conditions while adapting to evolving consumer preferences. There are a lot of needles to thread, but getting it right streamlines both the consumer and the back-end experiences to drive growth, keep fashion brands nimble, and unlock innovation. Top fashion ecommerce trends for 2025 Here’s a quick look at the trends we’ll be diving into: Social commerce and shoppable content Unified shopping experiences A personalized customer journey AI, AI, AI The continuation of the metaverse The rise of resale Digital payments as a growth-driver Sustainability—with caveats Community through IRL experiences Diversification of business models 1. Social commerce and shoppable content Social media plays an integral role in many online fashion brands’ ecommerce marketing strategies. That’s hardly surprising—our daily lives are no longer complete without our smartphones. The typical social media user now spends about 143 minutes daily on social media, which equals nearly 2½ hours. In an average lifespan of 73 years, that’s nearly 6 years of their life. Some 62% of consumers watch videos to learn about a product or brand before they buy. Platforms like TikTok and Instagram drive sales for large fashion brands, allowing shoppers to visualize the product on a real person—and there are bonus points if it’s through a social media influencer they already trust. But social media is no longer a place for shoppers to just learn about new fashion trends; it’s also a place for shoppers to buy as they learn, through in-app, integrated shopping experiences. This shortens the line between influencer product promotion and an actual purchase, right inside the apps where customers are already engaged, such as Instagram, TikTok Shop, Meta, buyable pins on Pinterest, and more. In fact, social commerce sales are expected to reach one in five sales by 2025, with 70% of Instagram users looking to the social media platform for their next purchase. Newer to the social selling sphere, TikTok Shop’s integrated shopping journeys show particular potential, providing access to the platform’s more than 33 million users. Current projections for shopping on the platform from Capital One indicate that 43% of users will use it to make purchases by 2027. TikTok Shop is easy to use with your Shopify store with an integration that helps you easily create videos, track conversions, and optimize campaigns through instant data reporting. That’s just one app among many in the Shopify app store which fashion retailers can easily plug in to instantly tap into the latest selling trend at low cost and low risk—and without having to wait 6 to 12 months to work its way through a developer’s queue. As social selling channels evolve, the ability to pivot your tech, selling, and marketing strategy quickly is key. 2. Unified shopping experiences The shopping experience is more multichannel than ever—especially in the fashion space. Consumers want to discover a new look from an influencer on social media, research reviews online, try items on in-store, and return them with a third-party logistics provider (3PL).
