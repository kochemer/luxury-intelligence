  "extractedText": "The jewellery retail industry stands at the cusp of a technological revolution, where artificial intelligence (AI) and automation are reshaping traditional business models and customer experiences. As we progress through 2025, these technologies are already proving instrumental in streamlining operations, optimising supply chains, and delivering unprecedented personalisation in customer service. This trend is only set to continue as technology develops and evolves at a rapid rate, with more and more retailers and suppliers embracing its capabilities. AI and automation: Transforming jewellery retail in 2025 The evolution of inventory management Duncan Fergusson, managing director of Sci-Net The jewellery sector’s unique characteristics — high-value items, seasonal demand fluctuations, and emotional purchase drivers — have historically made inventory management particularly challenging. Today though, advanced algorithms are transforming how retailers approach stock control, creating more efficient and responsive systems. Although not quite in widespread play yet, modern AI-powered inventory management systems are set to revolutionise how jewellers maintain optimal stock levels. These sophisticated platforms will combine analysis of historical sales data and seasonal trends with real-time consumer behaviour to accurately predict demand — painting an up-to-date picture that gives retailers unprecedented insight. This predictive capability will enable jewellery retailers to maintain ideal stock levels, thereby reducing the chances of overstocking and/or stockouts that can lead to lost sales opportunities. It also offers major benefits to suppliers too, as it can provide forecasted requirements, thereby speeding up the time to market as suppliers can make products in advance. Real-time inventory tracking is something that has become increasingly sophisticated over time, with automated systems monitoring stock levels across multiple locations and multiple channels. When inventory reaches predetermined thresholds, automated reordering processes are triggered — helping to ensure consistent stock availability, whilst also minimising human error in the replenishment process. Another hugely beneficial development is promotional event modelling. For specific events, such as Black Friday, retailers will be able to ramp up stock levels using a promotional calendar, with AI determining an increase in cover through analysis of historic throughput based on the type of promotion. Transforming the supply chain The jewellery supply chain has traditionally been complex. Involving numerous stakeholders — from refiners to manufacturers to retailers — it also requires the careful tracking of precious materials. Automation is streamlining these processes, introducing new levels of efficiency and transparency, as well as enhanced security. Modern supply chain management systems provide improved visibility throughout the entire journey — from raw material sourcing to final delivery. This transparency not only improves efficiency, it also addresses growing consumer demand for ethical sourcing and sustainability in the jewellery industry. Automated logistics systems are another aspect revolutionising order fulfilment, with advanced warehousing solutions enabling faster and more accurate processing. These systems reduce handling times, while minimising errors and optimising shipping routes — all of which helps to secure significant cost savings, while seeing improved customer satisfaction at the same time. Elevating the customer experience Perhaps the most visible impact of AI in jewellery retail is in its enhancement of the customer experience. The implementation of virtual try-on technology — powered by advanced AI algorithms — is transforming how customers shop for jewellery. These systems allow customers to visualise how pieces will look before making a purchase, playing into the emotional aspect. People can truly appreciate the look of any prospective jewellery they are intending to buy, encouraging them to commit to the purchase due to the simple fact that they like what they see. An added benefit is that this significantly reduces return rates, while also increasing customer confidence in online purchases. The ability to try something on is one of the core benefits of shopping on the high street and now those retailers who are purely online can tap into what has traditionally been a powerful tool of persuasion previously outside of their reach. The benefits don’t stop there though, with AI-driven personalisation extending beyond virtual try-ons. Sophisticated recommendation engines analyse customer preferences based on their purchase history and their browsing behaviour to suggest pieces that align with their individual tastes. I am sure most readers are familiar with online adverts following you around based on items you have previously viewed, but this level of personalisation is only set to increase — and it is something that c",
