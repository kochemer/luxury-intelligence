    "extractedText": "E-commerce software provider Shopify is bullish on AI-powered shopping agents, citing AI as an “incredible tool” to enable more entrepreneurs and calling it the “biggest shift in technology since the internet” during its third-quarter earnings call. The company, which partnered with ChatGPT maker OpenAI in September, reported that traffic from AI tools to its online stores is up 7x since January of this year, and purchases attributed to AI-powered search have increased by 11x. According to Shopify president Harley Finkelstein, the company’s advantage in the AI era comes from its ability to access the data from millions of merchants and billions of transactions, and its “founder mode” mentality to ship products quickly. This also includes its internal tools, like Scout, which uses AI to help Shopify employees search hundreds of millions of pieces of merchant feedback to make better product decisions. “And Scout is just one of many tools we’re developing to turn our own signals, whether it’s support tickets, usage data, reviews, social interactions, or even Sidekick prompts, into fast, informed decisions,” Finkelstein said on the call. “If you take away one thing from this call, let it be this: AI is not just a feature at Shopify. It is central to our engine that powers everything we build.” In addition to ChatGPT, Shopify is working with Perplexity and Microsoft Copilot on other in-chat shopping experiences. A recent Shopify survey found that 64% of shoppers said they’re “likely” to use AI to some extent when making purchases. “We’ve been building and investing in this infrastructure to make it really easy to bring shopping into every single AI conversation,” Finkelstein said. “The fact that we’re already working with the leaders in the space should, I think, be a testament to the fact that we want to make sure merchants on Shopify are better prepared than those that are not. It’s still obviously very, very early,” he continued. “But what we’re really trying to do is lay the rails for agentic commerce.” While the company is currently focused on building connections with AI agents, it’s also prepared for the fact that there will be “different permutations” of how agentic commerce will evolve, Finkelstein also noted, which means it needs to be ready for “whichever path wins.” Techcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

    "extractedText": "Post Post Share Annotate Save Print You ordered a new bed from a home furniture website last week. So why, instead of seeing ads for matching furniture, do you continue to see ads for the same bed you just bought? For the customer, this barrage of poorly targeted ads can be frustrating and off-putting. For the retailer, each ad is a missed opportunity to cross-sell and build customer loyalty. Experiences that are out of sync with a customer’s needs, preferences, and context are likely to erode rather than build trust. Shoppers get annoyed with ad noise from countless brands trying to make a sale, according to Ad Age. At the same time, shoppers want to feel like VIPs, and they increasingly expect brands to recognize and understand them. In a recent Deloitte Digital study, 69% of surveyed customers said they were more likely to purchase from a brand that personalizes experiences. But a disconnect often exists between the personalization that businesses deliver and what customers desire. More than 50% of these surveyed customers said personalization doesn’t meet their needs, interests, or preferences. Communication is often one-way, lacking the necessary feedback loop for businesses to engage customers. Personalizing Commerce with AI Artificial intelligence (AI) creates a prime opportunity for personalized commerce—the practice of tailoring shopping experiences to individual customer preferences using real-time data and technology. “Businesses of all sizes are looking for ways to break through the noise and attract new customers while increasing loyalty with existing ones,” says Frank Keller, executive vice president and general manager of PayPal’s large enterprise and merchant platform group. “Applied in the proper ways, AI can help develop new, trusted personalized experiences that make every customer feel like they are the most important.” AI uses machine learning to analyze customer preferences and predict in real time what shoppers may want to buy. By creating predictive customer insights from customer demographics—and online and in-store purchase histories and shopping activities—AI can empower businesses to offer more accurately personalized shopping experiences and can help shoppers engage with brands they love both online and in physical stores. A New Commerce Experience By analyzing SKU-level purchase data, AI can help businesses deliver hyper-personalized product recommendations and offers—down to a shopper’s size and preferred color. This enables businesses to personalize shopping experiences beyond demographics. Nearly two-thirds of customers expect to check out online in four minutes or less, according to Capterra. Businesses can use AI-powered customer insights to simplify and speed the checkout process by predicting and autofilling shipping and billing information for returning customers, even those checking out as guests. Businesses that use data analytics and AI also unlock new opportunities to grow through: • Improved conversion and increased revenue. Personalization can lift revenue by as much as 15%, according to McKinsey. • Increased customer loyalty. Sixty-five percent of shoppers say they will remain loyal to companies that offer more personalized experiences, Salesforce recently reported. • Lowered marketing costs. Being able to intelligently target customers helps businesses better strategize spending on broad marketing campaigns. A Foundation of Trust The promise of personalized commerce is enticing, but it can come to fruition only if customers agree to share their data. AI insights are only as good as the data AI can analyze, so customers need to trust that businesses will not misuse their information, improperly share it, or store it insecurely. Customers are uneasy about their personal data and how it’s used, Pew Research Center reports. To help ease these concerns, businesses must give them an easy way to opt out of sharing their data. “Gathering, accessing, and analyzing data are critical to creating a truly personalized experience and scaling this broadly—but consumers only want to share this data with brands they trust,” Keller says. “Today’s consumers are wary of just sharing their data blindly without control over what they share, how it can be used, and the ability to control it as they see fit.” The future of personalized commerce is already underway; 92% of surveyed companies say they use AI-driven personalization to drive growth, according to Twilio Segment. Those businesses that use AI to personalize commerce and deliver VIP experiences will improve their customer relationships and stand out from their competitors.

    "extractedText": "Just a day after Amazon introduced its new AI-powered Echo devices, Google debuted its refreshed lineup of Google Home and Nest devices, designed to showcase its AI assistant Gemini AI. The company also took the wraps off its revamped Google Home software platform and its new business strategy for the AI era. While the company still plans to compete on hardware, it also wants to make Gemini accessible to other manufacturers and businesses. It’s similar to how Google offers its own flagship Android devices with its Pixel line but allows other companies that make products compatible with Google’s platform to build their own Android smartphones with different form factors and price points. “We’re going to build flagship hardware in certain categories where we think there’s a lot of room to showcase innovation and push the boundaries of what’s possible with Gemini,” said Anish Kattukaran, chief product officer at Google Home and Nest, in a press briefing ahead of Wednesday’s announcement. “And then we’re going to complement that with the second part, which is, we don’t think that Gemini should be constrained to one set of devices from one OEM, at one set of price points that may make it accessible or inaccessible to a certain group of people,” he said. Image Credits:Google To demonstrate what that means, Google unveiled an overhauled lineup of Nest devices, including the Nest Cam Outdoor, the Nest Cam Indoor, and the Nest Doorbell, which take advantage of Gemini. It also teased an upgraded version of its Google Home speaker, due out in spring 2026, and a low-cost camera and doorbell sold in partnership with Walmart. However, the company decided to first bring Gemini to its existing device owners, provided they have certain hardware capabilities like sufficient processing power. (See list below.) This approach is intentional. Google doesn’t want to require people to buy new devices to access the power of its AI when it already has over 800 million devices in its ecosystem — both its own and those from third parties. Those devices are connected through the company’s Google Home Cloud-to-Cloud APIs and the smart home standard Matter, an industry protocol that allows devices from different manufacturers to work together. Plus, the company needs time to test the Gemini features and performance with existing customers before launching them on new flagship devices, like the upgraded Google Home smart speaker due out next year.

Walmart is Google’s first partner and is launching an affordable indoor camera and doorbell under the retailer’s onn brand. Talk to your Home With Gemini, the idea is to offer AI-powered devices that you can converse with in more natural ways, whether that’s interrupting or adding details after an initial inquiry, or asking more complex questions. Image Credits:Google For instance, if you said, “Play that song from that movie with Ben Affleck where he’s on a rocket and going off to like an asteroid or something,” the device could play an Aerosmith song from the movie “Armageddon.” As it streams the music, you could ask what the lyrics mean, and when it finishes, you could ask for other songs with a similar theme. You could also ask for a podcast featuring a specific person without having to remember the name of the show or the episode. Or you could ask Gemini to make up an interactive bedtime story for the kids where they help create the characters. In terms of household coordination, Gemini will be able to handle things like calendars, lists, timers, reminders, and other things that make your life easier at home.

    "extractedText": "A new report estimates that AI will be a larger-than-ever part of the online shopping process during Amazon’s Prime Day sale, which began Tuesday morning. Amazon’s annual sale, which this year spans four days (July 8-11), is predicted to drive $23.8 billion in online spending across U.S. e-commerce retailers, as other businesses run their own competing sales alongside the popular shopping event. Adobe, whose e-commerce division regularly releases estimates for online shopping events like Black Friday and others, offers a view into online commerce by tracking transactions online. The firm’s analysis encompasses over 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail websites, including 100 million SKUs across 18 product categories. This year, Adobe forecasts that Prime Day will be the equivalent of “two Black Fridays.” The $23.8 billion spent over the four-day period will represent 28.4% year-over-year growth and $9.6 billion more than the comparable period last year. Mobile will be a large part of that equation, accounting for more than half (52.5%) of sales, but this year, generative AI will also play a role. During the Prime Day event, Adobe estimates that traffic from generative AI sources will increase 3,200% year-over-year. This is still a much smaller source than other channels, like paid search and email, but Adobe believes it will continue to grow as consumers see the value in using AI for shopping. The company noted that GenAI-powered chatbots and browsers saw an initial surge in use during the 2024 holiday season, when traffic from those sources jumped 1,300% compared with the prior year from November 1 through December 31, 2024. The company also cited a survey of 5,000 U.S. consumers, which indicated that people were using GenAI for research (55% of respondents), product recommendations (47%), finding deals (43%), getting gift ideas (35%), finding unique products (35%), and creating shopping lists (33%).

AI providers have been capitalizing on this trend by integrating AI into shopping, as Google has with Gemini-enhanced product search and as OpenAI has with the addition of shopping features in ChatGPT, for example.

    "extractedText": "The U.S. holiday shopping season is expected to bring in $253.4 billion in online sales this year, up 5.3% year-over-year, according to a new report from Adobe’s e-commerce connected division, Adobe Analytics. Adobe Analytics develops its predictions by analyzing over 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail sites, encompassing 100 million SKUs across 18 product categories. Its analytics software is used by a majority of the U.S.’s top 100 online retailers, giving it deep insights into online shopping and consumer behavior. The company forecasts that Cyber Monday will again be the biggest shopping day of the year, up 6.3% year-over-year to reach $14.2 billion. Black Friday will also see higher growth, up 8.3% year-over-year to hit $11.7 billion. U.S. consumers on Thanksgiving Day are also expected to spend $6.4 billion online, up 4.9% year-over-year, as online sales start early. Driving the sales this holiday season will be consumer demand for discounts, where products are expected to be 28% off listed prices. Other trends like shopping from mobile devices, the use of AI services to shop, and buy now, pay later services are other factors behind the rise in online sales. Notably, Adobe predicts that generative AI-powered shopping will boom this year, with AI traffic set to rise by 520% year-over-year and peaking in the 10 days leading up to Thanksgiving. This follows the 1,300% increase in AI traffic to U.S. retail sites seen in 2024. The company expects consumers to largely use AI for research ahead of purchases, based on a survey of 5,000 U.S. consumers — 53% of whom said they may use AI services for this purpose. The survey also found that 40% said they would use AI for recommendations, 36% for deal finding, and 30% for gift inspiration. Adobe expects AI to be used most across categories like toys, electronics, jewelry, and personal care. Another trend expected this year involves mobile devices once again driving more online spend compared with desktop shopping, reaching a record 56.1% share. Last year, mobile accounted for 54.5% of the online transactions during this period, up from 51.1% in 2023. It’s unclear when the mobile growth will taper off and stabilize, especially given the larger-screened smartphone devices available on the market, which make it easier to shop online.

Cyber Monday is also expected to see a new BNPL milestone, when online spend in this category is expected to reach $1.04 billion, up 5% year-over-year. Social media will also drive more online sales this year. Social media advertising is expected to drive a 51% year-over-year increase in online revenue, up from 5% year-over-year growth in 2024. Top categories for spending overall include electronics ($57.5 billion, up 4% YoY), apparel ($47.6 billion, up 4.4% YoY), and furniture ($31.1 billion, up 6.5% YoY).

    "extractedText": "New data shows ChatGPT’s growing influence as a referrer to e-commerce websites, as well as how small its slice of this market is currently. According to a new analysis by mobile app insights provider Apptopia, ChatGPT referrals to retailer mobile apps increased 28% year-over-year over the Black Friday holiday shopping weekend, running from Thanksgiving Day on Thursday through Sunday. However, the use of ChatGPT may not be benefiting smaller retailers as much as it’s helping to further entrench the e-commerce giants Amazon and Walmart. This year, Amazon’s share of ChatGPT referrals grew to 54%, up from 40.5% in 2024. Walmart’s share, meanwhile, increased from 2.7% last year to now 14.9%. The data was collected by Apptopia’s U.S. panel, which is based on observed consumer activity on mobile devices. As it’s not first-party data, its figures are only estimates. For this analysis, the firm defined a referral session as a retail mobile app session that directly followed (within 30 seconds) a ChatGPT session. Despite the big jump from 2024, consumers’ use of AI chatbots to find e-commerce deals is still a small sliver of the overall referral market, Apptopia noted. Last year, ChatGPT’s referrals to e-commerce apps were only 0.64% of all ChatGPT sessions on Black Friday, and that figure only grew to 0.82% this year. In this case, a referral session was anytime ChatGPT either gave the searcher a shopping idea or the user clicked a link directly from their chat session that brought them to the retail app. Apptopia isn’t the only firm digging into how AI is impacting e-commerce during the busy holiday shopping season. Adobe also reported this week that AI traffic to U.S. retail sites (measured by shoppers clicking on a link) increased by 805% year-over-year on Black Friday, and those who landed on a retail site from an AI chatbot were 38% more likely to make a purchase. In addition, Adobe said that AI traffic to U.S. retail sites on Cyber Monday increased by 670%. In the holiday shopping season so far (November 1 to December 1), AI traffic is up 760%, it noted.

    "extractedText": "Google announced at Google I/O 2025 that it is adding multiple AI-powered features for online shoppers, including a new visual panel in Google Search’s AI Mode, personalized price tracking notifications with agentic checkout, and virtual try-ons. The new shopping experience is rolling out in AI Mode, where shoppers can view product visuals and other AI-powered guidance that leverages product data. For instance, if you search for a travel bag, the results will show you a panel of listings and images matched to your tastes that you can easily scroll through. And, if you want to narrow things down using a more specific query, such as “bags suitable for a trip to Portland, Oregon, in May,” AI Mode will run multiple simultaneous queries — which Google describes as a query “fan-out” — to figure out the best option for both long journeys and rainy weather. Image Credits:Google It will then update the panel of options to showcase those that are waterproof and those with easy access to pockets. As you continue to refine your query or add other specific filters for shopping, the visual panel on the right-hand will update to show new options. These features will arrive in the U.S. in the months ahead, says Google. The company is also adding a new price tracking feature with agentic checkout in the months ahead. Soon, consumers will be able to tap “track price” on any Google product listing. You’ll then be able to select a product, filtering for things like color and size, and specify the amount you want to spend on that item.

San Francisco | October 13-15, 2026 WAITLIST NOW Image Credits:Google Google will track the price and send you a notification when the price matches what you were looking to spend. After confirming the details, you can opt to buy the item by tapping a new “buy for me” option. After clicking the buy button, Google adds the item to the checkout cart on the merchant’s website and uses your Google Pay details to secure the purchase. This feature will initially launch with product listings in the U.S., Google says. Another new feature will allow shoppers to try on clothes virtually. While Google has offered something similar to virtual try-on tech, the feature only involved showing items on a diverse range of models’ bodies. Now, the company will allow you to try clothes on yourself, too. To do so, you’ll upload a full-length photo under good lighting where you’re wearing fitted clothing. Google says it’s using a new diffusion model for fashion to understand the human body and how different materials would fold and stretch on different people. Image Credits:Google Google’s virtual try-on feature is available to users in the U.S. under Google’s Search Labs starting today. Users who opt in will see a virtual try-on button next to product listings for shirts, pants, skirts, and dresses. You’ll also be able to share your look with friends or tap to shop similar styles. Google’s range of new AI shopping technology will challenge the work of other startups to various degrees. Notably, companies like Thrive-backed Doji and Stellation Capital-backed Vybe are working on technology to make virtual try-on easy and fun for users. Meanwhile, startups like Daydream, Cherry, and Deft have used AI to solve for product discovery. Plus, general-purpose AI-powered chatbots like ChatGPT and Perplexity have also added shopping features in recent months.

    "extractedText": "Pinterest CEO Bill Ready told investors on the company’s second-quarter earnings call that the social app and inspirational bookmarking site could be considered an “AI-enabled shopping assistant.” However, he thinks that the agentic web, where AI agents shop on users’ behalf, is still far in the future. The remarks were made in response to a question about the agentic web, which could impact the search funnel and businesses like Pinterest, which positions itself at the early stages of the shopping journey — around the time when users are seeking ideas that could later turn into purchases. Investors are likely concerned that if AI began to understand users’ interests, they could preemptively direct users to shop from their own personalized recommendations instead of using platforms like Pinterest. “I think this notion of an agent just going and buying all the things for you without you doing anything …” Ready said on the Q2 earnings call. “I think that’s going to be a very, very long cycle for that to play out, both in terms of how the users think about it, where the users are going to be ready to just let something go run off and do everything for them, save for maybe some very utilitarian journeys,” he noted. Still, he pushed for Pinterest to be thought of as an AI-enabled shopping assistant, saying that the company doesn’t talk about it that way, usually, because it’s not how users think of it. “But when users say things like ‘Pinterest just gets me,’ it’s because they can open the app and the app is going to make recommendations to them proactively on things that they’re really interested in, that align with their taste and their style, the way that a really great personal shopping assistant would,” he said. The company referred to this moment in time, when businesses are exploring all the ways to create new, AI-driven experiences, as a “Cambrian moment,” and touched on the various ways it had put AI to work already. This included AI-powered recommendation and personalization systems, the use of proprietary AI models (including multimodal AI that combines text and images), visual search experiences, conversational search, and AI-powered advertising efficiencies.

San Francisco | October 13-15, 2026 WAITLIST NOW Not addressed were the growing user concerns that too much of Pinterest is now filled with AI-generated, low-quality content. The situation became so bad that Pinterest earlier this year had to launch a new set of tools to fight this invasion, like labels for AI-generated images and controls for users to filter out generative AI pins. The discussion also omitted mention of mass user bans, which users believe stem from an overreliance on poorly designed AI moderation systems. (Pinterest wouldn’t say if that’s the case, only chalking them up to an internal error. However, similar problems are cropping up across social media, including on Facebook, Instagram, and Tumblr.) On the call, Ready also spoke about how Pinterest aims to compete in the war for AI talent, saying that people who want to work there care about AI that’s used for good and used “responsibly.” “On the mission side, I think we really, really punch above our weight,” the exec explained. “Both in terms of what we’re doing with tuning AI for positivity, creating a more positive alternative to what’s happening in the rest of social media,” he said. Pinterest stock dropped after earnings, as the company reported a beat on sales, with revenue of $998 million, but earnings per share at 33 cents (adjusted) fell short of the 35 cents analysts expected. The company also noted that over half its monthly users were Gen Z, and male users were up 95% year-over-year.

    "extractedText": "Google on Monday announced an update to its Chrome web browser that will introduce AI-generated store reviews to U.S. shoppers with the aim of helping to determine the best places to make a purchase. The feature, which will be available by clicking an icon just to the left of the web address in the browser, will display a pop-up that informs consumers about the store’s reputation for things like product quality, shopping, pricing, customer service, and returns. The feature, which is currently available only in English, will generate the summaries based on reviews from partners, including Bazaarvoice, Bizrate Insights, Reputation.com, Reseller Ratings, ScamAdviser, Trustpilot, TurnTo, Yotpo, Verified Reviews, and others. The feature will initially be available to Chrome on the desktop. When reached for comment, Google could not confirm if or when AI summaries would come to mobile devices. Image Credits:Google Google says the goal with the summaries is to provide a safer and more efficient shopping experience. However, the feature also helps Google better compete with other AI features rolled out by retail giant Amazon, which has been using the new technology to summarize product ratings and reviews, help customers find clothes that fit, get product recommendations and comparisons, and more. The changes arrive as Google, for the first time in many years, is facing a potential competitive threat to Chrome’s dominance in the global browser market. New AI-powered browsers like Perplexity’s Comet, The Browser Company’s Dia, Opera Neon, and perhaps a challenger from OpenAI have the search giant thinking about how to infuse AI more directly into its own web browser. For example, Google is developing an AI agent that would be able to take control of Chrome for you to take actions on your behalf. Plus, the company recently added support for its Gemini AI assistant in Chrome for Gemini subscribers. The move is also part of a broader initiative underway at Google to make it more of a modern-day shopping platform for consumers. Already, the company has tapped AI to help customers locate the products they’re interested in, get personalized product recommendations, and virtually try on clothes, and it has been developing tools for better price tracking, shopping in Google’s AI Mode, and AI-powered agentic checkout. (The latter two were announced at this year’s Google I/O developer conference. Google recently announced that getting outfit and room inspiration in AI Mode would roll out this fall.)

The company on Thursday unveiled a host of new tools and features, including conversational shopping in Google Search, new shopping features within its Gemini app, agentic checkout, and even an AI tool that can call local stores to find out if a product you want is available. The company believes the additions will help improve the online shopping experience, which can still today involve a lot of drudgery, explained Vidhya Srinivasan, VP and GM of ads and commerce at Google, in a press briefing ahead of the launch. “We feel it really shouldn’t be so tedious, and shopping should feel — and can feel — a lot more natural and easy,” she said. “The idea here is we want to hold on to all the fun parts of shopping, like the browsing, like the serendipitous discovery, and things like that, but then skip all the tedious, hard parts.” Image Credits:Google One update will allow consumers to ask shopping questions in AI Mode, Google’s conversational search feature that lets you use natural language queries in a chatbot-style interface. The responses will be tailored to your question, and the chatbot will provide images when you need visual inspiration, alongside other details like price, reviews, and available inventory. So if you were looking for cozy sweaters in autumn colors, you’d see photos of the options available to you. But if you were comparing items, like skin care products, Google may instead return insights in a comparison table. Image Credits:Google Google noted that AI Mode is powered by its Shopping Graph, which includes over 50 billion product listings, 2 billion of which are updated every hour, and said the inventory information you see is usually up-to-date. Another shopping update will enable the Gemini app to provide fleshed-out ideas as responses, instead of just text suggestions in response to shopping-related questions.

San Francisco | October 13-15, 2026 WAITLIST NOW The company confirmed that consumers using AI Mode will see sponsored listings, but as the features are still experimental, these ads won’t appear in the Gemini mobile app just yet. Notably, Google is rolling out agentic checkout within Google Search in the U.S., including in AI Mode. The feature is currently compatible with merchants like Wayfair, Chewy, Quince, and select Shopify stores. Image Credits:Google To use agentic checkout, you can begin by tracking an item’s price to be notified if the price drops to fall within your budget. You can then opt to have Google purchase the item for you on the merchant’s website using Google Pay. The company says it will always ask your permission first, and will have you confirm your purchase and shipping details. “This is helpful for shoppers, because they don’t have to constantly check to see if the item they want is on sale. And it’s great for retailers because it brings back the customer who might otherwise have moved on,” said Lilian Rincon, VP of product management for Google Shopping, during the briefing. “Agentic checkout is built on Google’s trusted shopping graph and also G Pay, so you can rest assured that you’re seeing accurate results and that your payment information is secure,” she noted. Image Credits:Google Another AI feature can call businesses on your behalf to find out if a store carries a product, how much it costs, and whether there are any promotions. The feature is built on Google’s Duplex technology, introduced back in 2018, as well as its Shopping Graph and payments infrastructure. After you’ve provided information about the product you’re looking for, the AI will call local stores and make inquiries about the product, then come back to you with a summary of its findings. This feature is rolling out now in the U.S. for specific categories like toys, health and beauty products, and electronics. To use this feature, you can search for products “near me,” then use the option “Let Google Call.” The AI will then walk you through questions ",

    "extractedText": "Venture capitalists have convinced themselves they’ve found the next big investing edge: using AI to wring software-like margins out of traditionally labor-intensive services businesses. The strategy involves acquiring mature professional services firms, implementing AI to automate tasks, then using the improved cash flow to roll up more companies. Leading the charge is General Catalyst (GC), which has dedicated $1.5 billion of its latest fundraise to what it calls a “creation” strategy that’s focused on incubating AI-native software companies in specific verticals, then using those companies as acquisition vehicles to buy established firms — and their customers — in the same sectors. GC has placed bets across seven industries, from legal services to IT management, with plans to expand to up to 20 sectors altogether. “Services globally is a $16 trillion revenue a year globally,” said Marc Bhargava, who leads GC’s related efforts, in a recent interview with TechCrunch. “In comparison, software is only $1 trillion globally,” he noted, adding that the allure of software investing has always been its higher margins. “As you get software to scale, there’s very little marginal cost and there’s a great deal of marginal revenue.” If you can automate services business, too, he said — tackling 30% to 50% of those companies with AI, and even automating up to 70% of those core tasks in the case of call centers — the math begins to look irresistible. The game plan seems to be working right now. Take Titan MSP, one of GC’s portfolio companies. The investment firm provided $74 million over two tranches to help the company develop AI tools for managed service providers, then it acquired RFA, a well-known IT services firm. Through pilot programs, says Bhargava, Titan demonstrated it could automate 38% of typical MSP tasks. The company now plans to use its improved margins to acquire additional MSPs in a classic roll-up strategy. Similarly, the firm incubated Eudia, which focuses on in-house legal departments rather than law firms. Eudia has signed up Fortune 100 clients including Cargill, Del Monte, and Stripe, offering fixed-fee legal services powered by AI rather than traditional hourly billing. The company recently acquired Johnson Hana, an alternative legal service provider, to expand its reach. GC looks to double — at least — the EBITDA margin of those companies that it’s acquiring, Bhargava explained.

The venture firm Mayfield has carved out $100 million specifically for “AI teammates” investments, including Gruve, an IT consulting startup that acquired a $5 million security consulting company, then grew it to $15 million in revenue within six months while achieving an 80% gross margin, according to its founders. “If 80% of the work will be done by AI, it can have an 80% to 90% gross margin,” Navin Chaddha, Mayfield’s managing director, told TechCrunch this summer. “You could have blended margins of 60% to 70% and produce 20% to 30% net income.” Solo investor Elad Gil has been pursuing a similar strategy for three years, backing companies that acquire mature businesses and transform them with AI. “If you own the asset, you can [transform it] much more rapidly than if you’re just selling software as a vendor,” Gil said in an interview with TechCrunch this spring. But early warning signs suggest this whole services-industry metamorphosis may be more complicated than VCs anticipate. A recent study by researchers at Stanford Social Media Lab and BetterUp Labs that surveyed 1,150 full-time employees across industries found that 40% of those employees are having to shoulder more work because of what the researchers call “workslop” — AI-generated work that appears polished but lacks substance, creating more work (and headaches) for colleagues. The trend is taking a toll on the organizations. Employees involved in the survey say they’re spending an average of nearly two hours dealing with each instance of workslop, including to first deci",

    "extractedText": "For years, when it was time for startups to start selling their product, they could turn to any number of traditional playbooks. But as with so many things, AI is changing how companies prepare to go to market. “You can do more with less than ever before,” Max Altschuler, general partner at GTMfund, told the audience at TechCrunch Disrupt last month. The challenge for founders and operators, though, will be threading the needle. While there has been some chatter of startups hiring developers more versed and loosing them on typical GTM problems, he said, there’s still a need for more specific domain expertise. “When you have great advisors around, you can learn some of the tried-and-true playbooks. Those things haven’t gone out the window. I think it’s still necessary that you have a general understanding of how and why certain things work in marketing,” Altschuler said. Alison Wagonfeld, vice president of marketing at Google Cloud, said the craft of marketing is still very much required. “You certainly need the AI knowledge, the AI curiosity, the technologists, but also understanding what the purpose of marketing is, to understand customer insights, to do research, to see what great creative is like,” Wagonfeld said. Teams that adopt AI, though, can move more quickly. “You can just get out there with so many more messages faster, and then you can think more holistically about what metrics am I driving for,” she added.

San Francisco | October 13-15, 2026 WAITLIST NOW Marc Manara, head of startups at OpenAI, has found many startups have embraced AI in their GTM strategy, though it’s not necessarily with the sole focus of minimizing how many resources they put toward it. “There’s a movement of, yes, you can do more with less, but you can also be very focused with how you do it,” he said. “The degree of personalization and signal following that you can do with AI is differentiated now.” Specifically, he said there are tools that help build leads that are much more sophisticated than in the past. Rather than just a simple query of a database, AI prompts can help startups find prospective customers that fit a very specific set of requirements. Inbound marketing has changed, too, he added, by using the results of those prompts to qualify and score inbound leads “with a lot more precision could have been in the past.” When it comes time for a startup to begin crafting its go-to-market strategy, Wagonfeld said it’s important to consider what qualities it might want in a GTM team. “It’s a change in hiring perspective, where in the past it was more about hiring specialists, people who really knew, sometimes even like a sub-specialty within marketing or within sales. And now it’s hiring for a sense of curiosity and understanding,” she said. “It’s almost the top thing to hire for now.” Topics AI, Google, google cloud, GTMfund, OpenAI, Startups, TechCrunch Disrupt, TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 Tim De Chant Senior Reporter, Climate Tim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "extractedText": "Back in August I wrote a little story about a Thiel Fellow named Mark Daniel who had raised $1.5 million to create a mobile fashion app called Strut. Well after a few months the app is now available for download on the Apple App Store and ready to help users socially discover new fashions and create outfits together. Strut is centered around the idea of helping users discover new apparel via mobile that they might want to buy. It does this by presenting them with 50 new pieces of clothing each morning, with a Tinder-like mechanism for swiping left on items they don’t like and swiping right on those they do. It uses machine learning to refine the items it presents to users and improves its targeting over time. The idea is that Strut will get to know their tastes better and provide clothing options more to their liking the longer that they use the app. If Strut were just about helping users to find new clothes, the app wouldn’t be that interesting. What makes it fun is the ability to create outfits around those finds and sharing them with others as part of some collaborative social fashion mashup. In addition to swiping right or left, users can also swipe up. That enables them to build a whole ensemble of clothing around the item. Find a shirt you like? Strut will show you a series of different pants, shoes, and jackets that you can match it up with. Once you create an outfit you can share it with your feed. That feature has been pretty popular with users so far: In the past six weeks since Strut opened its beta period, users are making an average of five or six outfits per week. And they’re spending about 15-20 minutes in the app per day, according to Daniel. Frankly it’s a little early to tell how successful the social aspects of the app will be, in part because there are a limited number of users in the company’s beta. But it’s easy enough to find Facebook and Twitter connections already using the app. Techcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | October 13-15, 2026 WAITLIST NOW And in theory at least, following people is just one more way to get exposed to new fashions that others share. Users can also share with their social feeds on other apps like Pinterest, Facebook, or Twitter. But the main point of Strut is that it’s a new way to enable mobile commerce specifically around clothing and fashion — which is an area that many have attempted but few have excelled at to date. On that front, Strut still has a lot of work to do. While it surfaces tens of thousands of items from a number of different retailers, if a customer wants to buy something, the app redirects them into the retailer’s mobile web experience. They then need to fill out credit card and shipping information for each individual retailer, which can be a hassle. So far Strut has succeeded in making some affiliate revenue, but to be really great, it will need to integrate one-click purchasing. To be fair, that’s something Daniel says the team is working on. Other features that Strut could add in future versions include messaging between users and the ability to create collections around certain types of clothing. For now though, the team is just happy to get the app in users’ hands and see what they do with it outside its beta.

For one, there were lots of apps. At New York Fashion Week, the Kardashian women introduced a whole line of them at the Apple Store. Rag + Bone teamed up with Uber to get users of the app to its secret show. Misha Nonoo ditched the runway altogether, organizing an “Instashow” where followers could view the new lines using special social media accounts set up for the occasion. Instead of the usual mix of celebrities, buyers, and editors, Givenchy allowed anyone to enter a lottery for 1,500 seats available to the public.

San Francisco | October 13-15, 2026 WAITLIST NOW New York wasn’t the only city whose designers seemed to be angling for a more egalitarian vibe. London Fashion Week moved their runway shows to a car-park in Soho, a move intended to bring the spectacle “closer” to retail in spirit. Fashion luminaries once again broke out the “i-word,” with Belinda Earl, style director at Marks and Spencer’s gushing “That’s what’s great about the Soho location, it feels much more inclusive.” Even the French said Fashion Week felt different this year, with many proclaiming that fashion had finally been “democratized” and some even comparing to a “spectator sport.” Not very Vogue. Taken together I started to realize that a lot had changed since I moved into the industry more than a decade ago. For a second it seemed like tech had started to democratize fashion the same way it democratized other industries such as entertainment. For the first time, Fashion Weeks worldwide seemed eager to play the crowd. You don’t have to be part of the elite to attend anymore, you just needed a smartphone. More Spectacle On The Runway Perhaps the most profound effect of technology on the fashion industry has been the increasing importance of spectacle. When I was a buyer, a lot of business happened immediately after the show. Merchants were eager to buy as soon as possible, and you’d often place orders directly after the show. Nowadays the opposite is true, as the tech behind fast-fashion and other technology means that trends change much faster than they used to. In that environment, it makes more sense to wait as long as you can before placing orders as you want to so you can account for trends and weather patterns. As a result we’re seeing shows that are more showy than they are practical. For designers, fashion week is no longer about deals. It’s about making an impression. Designers On Social Spectacle, as well as the desire to tap coveted and trendy younger demographics, is the main reason why technology is being leveraged by an industry that once didn’t value it. Fashion wasn’t changed much by Facebook or Twitter – neither were very visual mediums in the beginning. Instagram undoubtedly changed things for good by empowering a very young generation, fluent in social media, to collect a lot of influence very fast. It’s also made it harder to stand out, prompting a need to reach out to consumers more directly. Popular Instagram accounts are going to see more likes, comments, and follows coming directly from the brands themselves. This past Fashion Week, DKNY even did an Instagram Direct campaign to send people personalized content that gave a behind the scenes look into the work of the creative directors. While it’s certainly true that elements of this year’s fashion week had a more accessible, egalitarian vibe — Peter Copping from Oscar de la Renta turned heads for crediting his entire design studio in the show notes — it would still be a mistake to call this year’s fashion week “inclusive.” Fashion’s embrace of technology is just as much about the media landscape and money as it is about democratization. Technology may now enable us to have whatever we want shipped to our door. But don’t mistake",

The question is now down to whether startups offering such products can achieve a sustainable business model. Some of them have demonstrated that potential and attracted investors. ZMO.ai, founded by a team of Chinese entrepreneurs who have spent years studying and working abroad, just closed an $8 million Series A financing round led by GL Ventures. GGV Capital and GSR Ventures also participated in the round. The startup has found a healthy demand from fashion e-commerce companies that are struggling to hire and afford models due to their growing number of stock-keeping units (SKUs), or styles, as consumer tastes become more changeable. Using the generative adversarial network (GAN), ZMO has created a piece of software to help them create virtual full bodies of models by defining simple parameters like face, height, skin color, body shape and pose. “Traditionally, the entire cycle of garment manufacturing may take two to three months, from design, fabric selection, pattern making, modeling, to actually hitting the shelves,” says Ella Zhang, ZMO’s CEO and co-founder, a former engineer at Google and Apple. “We are flipping and shortening that process. [Customers] can now test a piece of clothing by putting it on a virtual model, which can go on the website. Once orders come in, the e-commerce customer can start manufacturing,” she tells TechCrunch. “They can also test what type of people would suit a certain product by trying it out on different virtual models.” It’s unsurprising that fashion e-commerce operators would find ZMO and its likes a cost-saving tool. Zhang says her company is in early discussion with fast-fashion giant Shein, which rolls out 2,000-3,000 new products per day, about potential collaborations.

San Francisco | October 13-15, 2026 WAITLIST NOW Going forward, ZMO is also planning to apply GPT-3, which uses big data and deep learning to imitate the natural language patterns of humans, to create speeches for models. As spooky as it may sound, the feature would make it breezy for e-commerce companies to churn out TikTok videos quickly and cheaply for product promotion. On average, e-commerce companies spend around 3%-5% of their annual gross merchandise value (a rough metric measuring sales, usually excluding returns and refunds) on photoshoots, according to Roger Yin, who worked at Evernote and ran his own cross-border e-commerce business before co-founding ZMO with Zhang. “Images play a big role in driving e-commerce sales. The problem is that the [sales] cycle is short but the cost of images is high,” Yin observes, adding that costs can be even higher for fashion companies with a quick turnover of styles. The goal of ZMO is to reduce the costs of photoshoots to 1% of GMV. Right now, 80% of ZMO’s customers are based in China, but it’s working to attract more overseas users this year using its new financial infusion. Operating with a team of 30 staff, the startup boasts 30 “medium and large-sized” customers, including Tencent-backed Chicv, one of Shein’s numerous challengers, and over 100 “small and medium” customers, such as dropshipping sellers. ZMO’s other co-founders include Ma Liqian, a Ph.D. in computer vision who graduated from Belgium’s KU Leuven, and Yang Han, who previously worked on AI-powered styling at Tencent and SenseTime.

Snap today confirmed that it has acquired Fit Analytics, a startup based in Berlin that has built technology to help shoppers find the right-sized apparel and footwear from online retailers, along with a wider set of personalization tools and other analytics to help retailers figure out how to sell more overall. Fit Analytics already works with a number of big retailers, including North Face, Asos, Calvin Klein, Patagonia, Puma, and many more — in all, some 18,000 retailers already. In other words, Snap is adding not just a technology team — there are 100 staff at the company, based in Berlin, who will be reporting to Snap VP of Engineering Nima Khajehnouri — but a substantial e-commerce technology business into its portfolio. Fit Analytics has confirmed that it will be continuing to operate its existing business, while also working on helping Snap build out its shopping platform. “If you are a Fit Analytics partner, this is only the beginning,” Fit Analytics’ CEO and co-founder Sebastian Schulze wrote in a blog post announcing the deal. “By leveraging Snap’s scale and capabilities, we will not only continue to service our existing clients, but also deepen our relationships and offerings with our brand partners and retailers. Our main focus going forward will be to scale the Fit Analytics business and work with Snap to grow their shopping platform, leveraging our technology and expertise. Our teams will be jointly executing on next-gen shopping, fashion and style offerings.” Fit Analytics’ technology lets people enter their own measurements into a tool that uses machine learning to match those dimensions up to the clothes or shoes in question to find the best fit.

San Francisco | October 13-15, 2026 WAITLIST NOW Notably, although it is not the focus for the company right now, Fit Analytics also has built technology to match clothing using images that customers upload themselves — an interesting area considering Snap’s focus on the visual experience, on visuals created by its users — and of course the features it has built around lenses and other augmented reality experiences to let people play with different versions of themselves and how they look. The terms of the deal are not being disclosed. Fit Analytics, which used to be called UpCload (and actually launched back in 2011 at a TC Disrupt event in Beijing focused mainly on “webcam” technology — this was the days before smartphone-created selfies were de rigueur) had disclosed less than $1 million in funding according to PitchBook data, although that list of customers implies that it was generating strong revenues. Social shopping spree Snap’s acquisition of Fit Analytics pulls on a few different strategic threads for the social media company. For starters, it will give Snap another way to diversify its revenues. The company is now making nearly $1 billion a quarter in revenues (in its Q4 earnings, it posted sales of $911 million). The majority of that is coming from advertising on Snapchat, so Snap is naturally looking for other ways of making money. Whether Fit Analytics is integrated into Snapchat or not, and regardless of what will happen with how Apple and Google let apps monetize on their mobile platforms, Fit Analytics is already likely pulling in a substantial amount of revenue by way of its e-commerce services for retailers. Covid-19 has led a lot of retailers to rethink how well their e-commerce experiences work, and that could have meant more activity for companies like Fit Analytics. All that will now be funneled on to Snap’s balance sheet. Its advertising business, meanwhile, reveals that Snap already has a substantial relationship with fashion and beauty brands. In ",

Offering a twist on the traditional experience, visitors to the Glendale, California shop at The Americana At Brand use an app to scan codes on displayed items from Steve Madden, Levi’s, Lacoste and other brands to send them directly to a fitting room or pickup counter. As TechCrunch previously reported, Amazon Style features hundreds of brands chosen by “fashion creators” and “feedback provided by millions of customers shopping on Amazon.com.” Scanning the QR code next to an item pops up a selector for sizes and colors, as well as details such as customer ratings and adds the item to a list for later perusing. Amazon Style doesn’t use the cashierless “Just Walk Out” tech found in Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods locations, instead opting for Amazon’s controversial Amazon One palm recognition service. But there is an AI element. As Amazon explains on the store’s webpage: “We’re bringing more looks and less clutter to in-store shopping. Our advanced machine learning algorithms continually refine to find looks just for you based on your preferences.” Fitting rooms are unlocked using the app and sport touchscreens that let shoppers continue requesting items to try on. Items found in the store can be bought online or in-store and, either way, returned in-store. Window shopping the Amazon way. Image Credits: Amazon Amazon has spent years experimenting with technology in the fashion space, notably with Echo Look, a since-discontinued connected camera that combined human and machine intelligence to recommend styles, color-filter clothes and keep track of what’s in customers’ wardrobes. The Echo Look tied into Prime Wardrobe, a program akin to those offered by Stitch Fix and Trunk Club that let users try on clothes and send back what they don’t want to buy. In March 2021, Amazon passed Walmart as the top apparel retailer in the U.S. partly due to the pandemic-linked boom in online ordering, Wells Fargo reported. Analysts at the bank estimated that domestic sales of apparel and footwear on Amazon last year exceeded $41 billion, including sales through third-party sellers. Amazon has been less successful where it concerns brick-and-mortar, having recently announced that it would close dozens of physical bookstores and mall pop-up kiosks to focus on other areas of the retail business. Still, Amazon’s physical stores generated roughly $4.68 billion in Q4 2021 as bets like Just Walk Out — and perhaps even barbershops — begin to gain traction.

    "extractedText": "Finesse, a startup promising to take the guesswork and waste out of fashion, is announcing that it has raised $4.5 million in seed and pre-seed funding. Founder and CEO Ramin Ahmari said the tremendous waste in the fashion industry has become a badly kept secret, with Burberry recently facing a backlash over its practice of burning unwanted products, and the industry as a whole producing an estimated 13 million tons of textile waste each year. Finesse is looking to change that, Ahmari said, in part by taking advantage of the fact that fashion trends are moving out of the “hermetically sealed” world of catwalks and onto social media, where new products take off “on the backs and bodies and posts” of influencers like Kylie Jenner. “This is data we have access to,” he said. Noting that he previously worked in finance, Ahmari added that the stock market is “much more unpredictable” than the fashion industry — there just hasn’t been a tech startup applying tools like natural language processing and deep learning to fashion. “In the simplest terms, you can think of what we do as seeing when Kylie posts a picture on Instagram and people go crazy about it … and then you see that happen not just on Kylie’s post but across Instagram, TikTok, Google Trends,” he said. “We predict the establishing of a trend before it goes super viral.” Image Credits: Finesse Finesse then uses this data to design new products. Ahmari said that by taking advantage of a “very fast supply chain,” along with tools like CLO 3D-modeling software, Finesse can go from identifying a trend to having a product available for purchase in less than 25 days. While the startup is officially launching today, it’s already been selling products through “drops,” where customers vote for and pre-order products that will only be available in limited quantities. Ahmari said Finesse focuses on selling unique pieces rather than staples, but because it’s confident about consumer demand, it can keep things much more affordable — the products currently for sale range from $8 to $116.

San Francisco | October 13-15, 2026 WAITLIST NOW Unlike most fashion companies, Ahmari said that Finesse does not need to employ a giant design department, although he suggested that team members like Vice President of Product Andrea Knopf and Head of Product Development Brittany Fleck — who work in tandem with the startup’s algorithms — are “artists in their own right.” “Unless we have true AI — which we’re very far from — you are never going to have a machine that’s purely creative,” he said. “You have to have feedback cycles … What we are eliminating is the job where it’s just an intern doing grunt work, all of these people just going through Instagram to find new fashion trends.” Ahmari also said that with its emphasis on sustainability and connecting with the LGBTQ community (Ahmari identifies as queer and nonbinary, and all of the startup’s products are designed for any gender), Finesse is aimed squarely at Gen Z consumers who are tired of fashion dictated by “white, older, cisgender men.” The startup’s investors include former Twitter Head of Engineering Alex Roetter, Collective Health CEO Ali Diab, Hoxton Ventures, MaC Venture Capital, Mango Capital and Fab Fit Fun co-founder Sam Teller. “We believe that Finesse is truly the future of fashion, from its trend prediction to sustainable supply chain and manufacturing,” said MaC Managing Partner Marlon Nichols in a statement. “We hope other fashion brands can learn from Finesse’s disruption in the space and we’re eager to see what’s next.” Amazon Fashion launches a custom clothing service, Made for You Topics Alex Roetter, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Fashion, MaC Venture Capital, Marlon Nichols, TC Anthony Ha Anthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

    "extractedText": "After recently turning to generative AI to enhance its product reviews, e-commerce giant Amazon today shared how it’s now using AI technology to help customers shop for apparel online. The company explains it’s now using large language models, generative AI and machine learning to power four AI-powered features that will help customers find clothing that fits — an ongoing challenge when shopping online and the leading cause for apparel returns. According to a study by Coresight Research, the average return rate for clothing ordered online is 24.4%, which is eight percentage points higher than the overall online return rate. In addition, retailers and brands said online returns had grown over the past two years. Often, that’s in part because today’s consumers will buy an item in multiple sizes or colors and then return those that don’t work out, as the process of home try-ons and shipping items back has become easier. To address this challenge, Amazon has introduced AI into the online shopping experience in four ways: in personalized size recommendations, a “Fit Insights” tool for sellers, AI-powered highlights from fit reviews left by other customers and reimagined size charts. With the personalized size recommendations, Amazon Fashion used AI to develop a deep learning algorithm that will help customers find their best-fitting size across a variety of styles. This system works by considering the size relationship between brands’ size systems, the product’s reviews and the customer’s own fit preferences. The information is combined in real-time to make suggestions of the best-fitting size for a customer and adapts as the customer’s size needs change. The company also uses AI to help them discover the styles that fit them best. However, this feature can be imperfect if a family member regularly shops for another — like their teen son or daughter — as it confuses the system as to what size the customer is versus the child. (Amazon says this would not occur if the customer was browsing a children’s department versus an adult’s; it also notes that customers can create separate profiles for fit preferences through the “find your size” feature.) Image Credits: Amazon Another new feature, “Fit Review Highlights,” could help combat that problem, however. This feature is an extension of the newly added AI-generated Customer Review Highlights introduced in August 2023, which provide a short paragraph summary that details the customer sentiment and product features, as well as provides key product attributes as clickable buttons. Image Credits: Amazon With the Fit Review Highlights, Amazon extracts information about the apparel’s fit from the customer reviews, including things like size accuracy, garment fit on specific body areas and fabric stretch. Large language models extract details from the customer reviews and then AI summarizes the findings into an easy-to-read highlight personalized to the user, Amazon explains. This could help save users time as they wouldn’t have to read through hundreds of reviews to get a sense of the item’s fit.

With large language models, Amazon Fashion is extracting and cleaning product size charts from multiple sources and then transforming the data into standardized sizes. This process will remove duplicate information and auto-correct missing or incorrect measurements, leading to more accurate charts — and therefore, fit. Image Credits: Amazon Sellers, too, will gain access to AI-powered insights. With a Fit Insights Tool from Amazon Fashion, sellers are provided with an understanding of a customer’s fit needs so they can improve how they communicate sizing to customers — e.g. “true to size,” or if an item runs smaller or larger, for instance. This information can also be used to guide their future manufacturing efforts, Amazon notes. In this case, large language models are used to extract and aggregate customer feedback on fit, style and fabric in addition to retur",

    "extractedText": "In fashion design, success is often determined by talent, hard work and a sprinkle of luck. In the era of big and artificial intelligence, however, fashion design has become somewhat more predictable. Leveraging both realms of technologies, California-based Jellibeans has built a set of software that analyzes fashion trends and tells users where their designs stand on the market; it also offers a platform for various stakeholders in the design process to exchange ideas anywhere in the world. Jellibeans’ suite of products has garnered the attention of high-street knitwear supplier Aussco, which recently invested $1 million in the five-year-old startup. The traditional fashion design process can be manual, slow and bound by geographical location. To disrupt the old regime, Jellibeans created a combination of Slack and Trello for designers, buyers and merchandisers to collaborate remotely. Rather than sitting in the same meeting room, the buyer and merchandiser working with the designer can see the works through Jellibeans’ interactive design platform and leave comments. Collections that used to take two to three months to develop can now be done in just a few weeks, Joanne Chow, CEO and co-founder of Jellibeans, told TechCrunch. Atop the collaboration tool are Jellibeans’ three main analytical features — trend forecasting, which gathers market insight and data from retailers, social media and other relevant channels about fashion brands to predict future trends like the popularity or decline of predetermined styles, for example, the minute details of what material or color is trending; a benchmarking tool, which uses AI and historical data to look at competing brands’ pricing strategies or similar-looking products; and lastly, generative AI, which is meant to assist designers in decision-making rather than substitute their originality, which has led to an ongoing debate in the creative industry. “A lot of people will criticize generative AI for not being original, so instead of using it for creation of this new product itself, I actually encourage people to use it to cross-check their work to see whether there’s any plagiarism,” Chow said. For instance, a designer developing a green turtleneck can upload their design to Jellibeans’ platform, called jelli.studio, and see the other green turtlenecks carried by other brands through the startup’s database, which keeps an evolving library of over 10 million fashion retail products. If the design strikes as too similar to an existing product, the designer can use Jellibeans’ Stable Diffusion-based AI tool to tweak the sweater.

Even before a designer puts down their first sketch, they can check through Jellibeans what sort of turtlenecks have done well historically. TikTok influencers who run their own collections can also benefit from Jellibeans’ generative AI features, Chow reckoned, as the startup’s goal is to “help designers become independent by using data.” But the startup is also eyeing bigger clients. Its investor Aussco, which is also its user, has supplied knitwear to The Kooples, Kate Spade, Coach, Alexander Wang, Ted Baker, Maje and North Face among others. “Democratizing design and enabling all stakeholders to collaborate on the design-to-production workflow within a single platform like jelli.studio enables even larger operations like ours to radically improve efficiency by saving us much needed time and money amid today’s voracious appetite for new designs, all the while reducing waste,” Grant J.E. Philips, senior vice president at Aussco, said in a statement. “When I present this product [to big brands], I don’t work on the AI part,” said Chow. “I explained to a lot of people on the C suite level that it provides a lot of the business analysis that you may usually have to pay a consultant for, but you can have it by pressing the button because we know how to create these reports.” Deep Agency shows the perils of applying AI to the fa",

Subscribe: Apple Podcasts Spotify RSS All episodes All episodes Details Transcript May 17, 2022 THE YES, a shopping app for fashion brands, uses a sophisticated algorithm to create and deliver a personalized store for every shopper, based on her style preferences, size, and budget. After launching the app in 2020, the founders must decide whether to continue developing the algorithm to deliver on the company’s customer value proposition or to focus their resources on new customer acquisition, with the idea that more users on the app would improve the algorithm’s performance. Harvard Business School senior lecturer Jill Avery and THE YES co-founder and CEO Julie Bornstein to discuss this make-or-break dilemma in the case, THE YES: Reimagining the Future of e-Commerce with Artificial Intelligence (AI). This episode was recorded live at Harvard Business School on March 30, 2022. BRIAN KENNY: On June 18, 1956, ten mathematicians gathered at Dartmouth College on the top floor of Kemeny Hall for a six-week workshop on how to make machines improve themselves and solve the kinds of problems now reserved for humans. It was called the “Design Workshop on Artificial Intelligence,” giving a name to a field that, depending on who you ask, could either save the world or destroy it. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle of that spectrum. Although, much about AI is still the stuff of science fiction, many practical applications have made their way into our daily lives. Brands like Netflix, Tesla, and Pandora are pushing the boundaries on AI and finding new ways to delight and engage customers. But for many sectors, the field is still wide open and waiting on a game changer. Today on Cold Call, we’ve invited professor Jill Avery and case protagonist, Julie Bornstein, to discuss the case entitled THE YES: Reimagining the Future of E-Commerce with Artificial Intelligence. I’m your host, Brian Kenny, and you’re listening to Cold Call on the HBR Presents Network. Jill Avery is an expert on brand management and customer relationship management. Before coming to HBS, she managed several world class consumer brands, including Gillette, Braun, Sam Adams, and AT&T. Julie Bornstein has spent her career at the intersection of retail and technology. She is the co-founder and CEO of THE YES, and the protagonist in the case we’re going to discuss today. She’s beaming in from San Francisco. It’s great to have you both here today. This is a special episode of Cold Call. We are actually taping this in front of a live audience at Harvard Business School, make some noise so they can hear you. That’s the audience that’s in the classroom. This is one of the classrooms at Harvard Business School, where we teach cases every day to our MBA students and Executive Education participants. So, we’re really happy to be able to do this live taping as part of a celebration of the 100th anniversary of the Case Method at Harvard Business School. So, this is a big day at the school, and we’re happy to have several hundred people streaming this as well on YouTube. So, let’s just dig in. Why don’t we start with you, Jill. Because it’s the 100th anniversary of the case method, I thought I would just pull the lens back a little bit and ask you the first question about what makes an enduring case? Why is this case one that will endure over time? JILL AVERY: Sure. I think to me, the biggest thing an enduring case needs to be ",

Backed by Wobemail Online Services LLP and Stradigi Ventures, the Canadian startup is leveraging the features of product images to better grasp customers’ tastes and ultimately increase sales for retailers. The inspiration for Propulse came from CEO Eric Brassard’s experience working for Saks Fifth Ave. He explained to me that top salespeople on the floor can earn almost $200,000 per year. The art of selling clothing is recognizing the tastes and personalities of customers quickly and recommending appropriate items. More traditional applications of machine learning to product recommendations are powered by collaborative filtering. Retailers monitor the products all customers view before making a purchase, and recommend similar products to similar customers. This model has proven very effective for companies like Amazon, Spotify and Netflix. However, the model tends to benefit larger companies over smaller ones. Models improve with data, and it can be a challenge to overcome the cold start problem if you’re just starting out and don’t have much more to go on than an IP address for location and weather data. Propulse is focused on marketing its service to small and medium retailers. These businesses are small with respect to Nike or Zara, but are often still household names. Frank + Oak was an early customer of Propulse. The fashion retailer has switched strategies quite often as of late, but has always staked its brand on personalization. Ethan Song, CEO of Frank + Oak, told TechCrunch that his company is seeing 2.5X conversions with a new recommendations page powered by Propulse, though it’s tough to say how much of that is a result of marketing and the existence of the page itself versus the technology powering it.

San Francisco | October 13-15, 2026 WAITLIST NOW “The marketing is key to drive the customer to go to that page but product drives conversion,” asserted Song. “If you recommend the wrong products you could convert less not more.” Retailers get charged either by volume, the more compute used to power the recommendations or performance. In the latter case, Propulse gets compensated on improvement. This requires companies to track changes in conversions, but it’s an easier pill to swallow for retailers that are pitched AI solutions to improve revenue on a daily basis.

    "extractedText": "Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) offer new ways for consumers to collect, wear and trade fashion online, and now that most fashion shows have scaled back or gone virtual, they may become an important tool for the industry. Because some of the most profitable NFTs are produced by celebrities with teams, it makes sense that music corporations, fashion brands and designers are venturing into the NFT market as well. Just this month, sneaker brand RTFKT Studios garnered $3.1 million in seven minutes by selling crypto collectibles. In December 2020, NFT startup Enjin partnered with Netherlands-based fashion house The Fabricant on a virtual collection. Real-life fashion brands use NFTs for marketing in virtual worlds like Minecraft, plus several Atari and Microsoft video games. “Brands are coming up with some creative solutions because the pandemic is persistent, and fashion is something that is so close to our identities,” said Bryana Kortendick, Enjin’s VP of operations and communications. “You can snap a photo of yourself wearing your Atari-branded NFTs. You’ll also be able to wear them in video games.” Breakout NFT star Beeple said he imagines a future where fashion NFTs could be redeemed for specific items in physical stores, especially at luxury retailers like his former client Louis Vuitton. “You can relate NFTs to clothing in new and interesting ways,” he said. “This will be seen as the next chapter of digital art history. This is a continuation of digital art history that started decades ago, by that I mean art made on a computer and distributed through the internet.” Fashion designers like Schirin Negahbani are already creating NFTs that represent actual clothing. Precisely because multimillion-dollar NFT sales are breaking records, spectators have been prompted to question the role speculative trading plays in this trend. Textile designer Amber J. Dickinson says fashionable NFTs shouldn’t primarily be viewed as speculative trading opportunities. “The way I think fashion translates to the digital world is to view an NFT as a collectible piece of the garment for history,” said Dickinson, known for hand-made silk scarves and her work with Alexander McQueen. “I would only buy art as a piece that I liked. Whether digital or in the real world, I don’t take an investor’s point of view.” Techcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | October 13-15, 2026 WAITLIST NOW There are many fashion fans who disagree with Dickinson, preferring to invest through assets like Birkin bags. They may have a different approach to NFTs. The DIGITALAX crypto fashion platform, for example, is being built with a plethora of trading features. As for Dickinson, she said she is still looking for her tribe of crypto-savvy artists on Twitter. “There’s too much fast fashion and consumers are not encouraged to hold a particular item or style,” Dickinson said. “I hope NFTs will bring back that mentality of treasuring a piece of fashion. Some people already collect shoes, don’t they?” Dickinson aims to make her first NFTs in 2021, fundraising to manufacture her collection of printed silk scarves. It’s a slow process, she said, because she feels intimidated by the technology and isn’t sure which platform is the best way to find collectors, not traders. Because she wants to avoid the NFT hype, she says she’s not in a rush. “I only came back onto Twitter because of this NFT movement,” Dickinson said. “It’s nice to have direct access to a community of artists. It’s about trying to find the right audience.” Crossing over to the video game community Brands like Gucci are already exploring ways to find new audiences through video games like Roblox and Animal Crossing. Blockade Games CTO Ben Heidorn says NFTs will be the next step in that evolution. “We would like to do a fashion line that has a digital analog; it could be displayed during times like New York Fashion Week,” Heidorn said. “We’re going to have an expansion set that feels like Magic the Gathering — expansion sets every few months. There will be missions and campaigns, all the nerdy fun stuff.” Blockade Games CEO Marguerite deCourc",

    "extractedText": "The luxury membership platform Vivrelle, which allows customers to rent high-end goods, announced Thursday the launch of an AI personal styling tool called Ella as part of its partnership with fashion retailers Revolve and FWRD. The launch is an example of how the fashion industry is leveraging AI technology to enhance customer experiences and is one of the first partnerships to see three retailers come together to offer a personalized AI experience. Revolve and FWRD let users shop designer clothing, while Revolve also has an option to shop pre-owned. The tool, Ella, provides recommendations to customers across the three retailers on what to purchase or rent to make an outfit come to life. For example, users can ask for “a bachelorette weekend outfit,” or “what to pack for a trip,” and the technology will search across the Vivrelle, FWRD, and Revolve shopping platforms to create outfit suggestions. Users can then check out in one cart on Vivrelle. In theory, the more one uses Ella, the better its suggestions become. It’s the fashion equivalent of asking ChatGPT what to wear in Miami for a girl’s weekend. Image Credits:Vivrelle Blake Geffen, the CEO and co-founder of Vivrelle (which announced a $62 million Series C earlier this year), told TechCrunch that she hopes Ella can take the “stress out of packing for a vacation or everyday dressing. “Ella has been in the works for quite some time,” she told TechCrunch, adding that it took about a year to build and release the product. This is actually the second AI tool from the three companies. The Vivrelle, Revolve, and FWRD partnership earlier this year also launched Complete the Look, which offers last-minute fashion suggestions to complement what’s in a customer’s cart at checkout. Their latest tool, Ella, however, takes the fashion recommendation game to another level.

Even the 90s movie “Clueless” showed Cher picking outfits from her digitized wardrobe. This current AI boom has led to rapid innovation and democratized access to AI technology, allowing many fashion companies to launch personalized AI fashion platforms and raise millions while doing so. “With Ella, we’re giving our members as much flexibility and options as possible to shop or borrow with ease, through seamless conversations that allow you to share as little or as much as you want, just like talking to a live stylist,” Geffen said. “We’re excited to be the first brand to integrate rental, resale, and retail into one streamlined omnichannel experience.” Topics AI, AI, Fashion Dominic-Madori Davis Senior Reporter, Venture Dominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

In her role as principal at ThoughtWorks, she oversees creating differentiating value propositions and products for brands, using lean enterprise continuous delivery for in-market releases in weeks. In retail, innovation is the name of the game. Increasingly, retailers are staying ahead through unique in-store experiences that inspire shoppers through social lifestyles. Take a look at STORY, a Manhattan retailer that continually changes everything in store, from products to fittings to events based upon different themes like “Love” or “Made in America.” They are described as a monthly magazine, meets art gallery, meets retailer concept. Taking the in-store experience to a whole new level, IKEA recently hosted a “one-night-only” sleepover for shoppers at its store near Sydney. Rooms that were advertised on Airbnb described in detail themes for individual suites, such as “reminiscent of a Swedish summer cottage.” And Burberry is bringing fun and engaging in-store experiences to the luxury retail scene with digital rainstorms and a digital runway nail bar. These and many other forward-thinking retailers are changing the way we think about how we tie digital to physical in-store, by morphing product and channel focused “customer experience” to “experiential,” blazing trails using community and entertainment as their primary differentiators. This is where retail is heading – toward a beautiful fusion of exciting invention and customer-focused retail concepts: Face-to-Face Interaction The assumption that digital and mobile self-service will drive sales will shatter starting with Millennials, who are twice as likely as their predecessors to shop with others and avoid isolation. Human interface and interaction across channels will be considered table stakes in the next 10 years. Hated interactive voice response (IVR) menus will disappear when customer service operators, following Zappos’ lead, realize IVR increases attrition and is less profitable than live customer service representatives. Clunky online chats will move over to Skype-type conversations, where the reps assigned to take shoppers’ calls will be matched by personality, health, life, and career goals and aspirations.

San Francisco | October 13-15, 2026 WAITLIST NOW Socially Enriching Experiences All the Rage To magnify the in-store experience, retailers, airlines, banks, gyms and laundromats will see a surge of even more cafés, bars, living rooms, dance clubs, gaming centers, wellness classes and organic klatches. In the next 10 years, the real retail winners will be those who move to fit in with those existing social hotspots to enhance the experience, rather than try to become a new hangout. Pop-up shops will continue to pop up and pop down, parking lots will be full of self-drive electric cars, and the concept of “retailtainment” will again be front and center. As Generation Z’s inclination toward shared experiences over possessions endures, the retail industry should be prepared to adjust for these elevated perspectives on value. What’s more, we will see a stream of urban migration to smaller city apartments by Generation Z, resulting in a rise of “customer closets in the cloud,” inspired by e-retailers like Rent the Runway. H&M and Zara fast fashion will still be a “go-to” retail concept, but “wear-it-once” fashion for single events and occasions will soar in popularity. The rental subscription model will explode and provide consumers with options that go beyond clothing — from event organizers renting wedding gowns and party dresses to furniture retailers renting seasonal furnishings and one-time home entertaining decor. 3-D and Virtual Shopping Will Redefine Instant Gratification In the next 10 years, in-home 3-D printers will be a staple in most U.S. households, and early 3-D aggregators will siphon market share by providing instant product delivery through direct downloads.

Available on the web and iOS devices, The Floorr offers tools for conducting sales, hosting tailored styling sessions, creating mood boards, and engaging in text or voice chats with clients, all in one place. The company recently introduced a new styling tool called “Styling Sessions,” allowing stylists to create complete outfit looks using products from The Floorr’s marketplace or by uploading images or taking pictures of in-store items on their phones. Additionally, The Floorr formally announced Thursday its $1.7 million pre-seed funding round, backed by Net-a-Porter co-founder and investor Carmen Busquets (who is also an adviser for The Floorr) and Nigora Tokhtabayeva, a jewelry designer and founder of Tabayer. Styling Sessions featureImage Credits:App Store Screenshot Since beginning her career as a sales associate at Harrods in 2000 and later shifting to a leadership role for Net-a-Porter’s personal shopping service, founder Lupe Puerta has witnessed an increasing trend among luxury brands to adopt digital platforms to enhance the one-on-one styling experience. Virtual consultations and online styling services are common nowadays. For instance, companies like Next Level Wardrobe, Thread,and Wishi, among others, offer digital fashion services. Not to mention, the rising popularity of virtual try-on tech, AI-powered style assistants, and subscription boxes (Stitch Fix, Wantable and DailyLook) makes finding curated looks that much easier. Lupe PuertaImage Credits:The Floorr However, digital solutions for personal stylists, especially freelancers, remain relatively limited. “I wanted to create what my community needed in the form of an app by [helping] personal shoppers have the tools to really be agile and create beautiful content in one place and have that instant interaction with customers,” Puerta told TechCrunch. “Instead of creating PDFs, sending screenshots on WhatsApp, or sending an email, [The Floorr] has everything centralized in one place and gives them access to their business and analytics, allowing them to be more entrepreneurial.” Another tool available on the platform is a sales dashboard for stylists, which displays analytics like the total number of clicks, orders, items sold, and weekly/monthly earnings.

San Francisco | October 13-15, 2026 WAITLIST NOW Stylists and their clients have access to a wide selection of luxury items, thanks to partnerships with high-end retailers, such as Bergdorf Goodman, Browns, Chloé, Farfetch, Neiman Marcus, Net-a-Porter, Saks and SSense. The company will continue to expand the list. Notably, personal shoppers receive an 80% commission from sales, while The Floorr takes 20%. This is higher than what personal shoppers are estimated to earn in typical retail settings, which varies depending on who you ask (and what products are being sold). The average retail commission rate for apparel is approximately 15%. However, for luxury fashion, the rate is likely lower. Puerta said that, based on her own experience, “In a traditional in-house brand/multi-brand retailer setting, personal shoppers and client-facing staff earn a base salary that will vary depending on their seniority. They may also earn commission, which is likely to be between 0.5% and 2.5% and again will depend on their seniority and the amount of sales they’re generating each month.” The company has onboarded 200 personal shoppers so far. On the consumer-facing side, The Floorr helps customers with a taste for luxury fashion (and the financial resources to indulge in it) to connect with a stylist to handle their shopping needs remotely, eliminating the need for in-person meetings. Customers must be personally invited by a stylist to use the client-focused app. The Floorr’s clientele comprises business professionals and Hollywood celebrities.

    "extractedText": "Ole (pronounced “o-lay”), an on-demand fashion app that promises to deliver designer clothing to you in less than an hour, recently closed a $1.5 million funding round, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. This brings the total amount raised to $2 million — Ole secured $500,000 from Y Combinator last year. Ole makes it easy for last-minute shoppers to purchase outfits in time for special occasions, vacations or events. The app allows you to browse and shop at nearby luxury stores, including Miu Miu, Acne Studios, Isabel Marant, Fleur du Mal, Lisa Yang and more. The company plans to use the new capital to further develop the product as well as partner with more brands to expand its fashion offering. Investors that participated in this round include AI Global, Goodwater Capital and Light Ray Ventures, as well as Spring Studios CEO Giuseppe Stigliano and Gad Allon, professor of operations, information and decisions at the Wharton School. There are a few significant differences between Ole and other fashion delivery apps. For instance, Ole allows you to return clothes as soon as they’re delivered. Ole’s “Try At Home” service is meant to feel like the typical in-store fitting room experience but more convenient since you’re at home. You can select multiple sizes of one item and, once delivered, the messenger waits up to 15 minutes for you to come back down and return the items you don’t want. The delivery person won’t leave until you sign off on the transaction. You pay for the items you keep in addition to a $5 delivery fee. When it comes to online shopping, returns are a huge hassle for most customers, resulting in wasted time out of your day and delayed refunds. Decreasing the return cycle from weeks to an hour improves the experience for customers and retailers alike. According to a 2022 survey, returns cost U.S. online retailers 21% of a product’s cost value. Image Credits: Ole Another aspect of Ole that stands out is it guarantees same-day delivery in just 50 minutes. For reference, London-based competitor NIFT (Need It For Tonight) promises delivery within 90 minutes. Plus, Ole messengers deliver items on bicycles in order to promote sustainability, a refreshing change for an industry responsible for around 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions.

San Francisco | October 13-15, 2026 WAITLIST NOW Messengers are vetted based on “level of service and interest in fashion,” co-founder and CEO Alon Hendelman explained. Fifty percent of the delivery team are women, and Ole pays them “higher than the market standard,” he said, yet didn’t specify the amount. “As our mission is to provide an amazing experience from online to on-ground, Ole’s messengers are trustworthy contractors we select carefully,” Hendelman added. Image Credits: Ole Regarding Ole’s business model, the company takes a 25% commission from retail partners for every order. The average order value (AOV) is $450, Hendelman told us. “About 40% of our users are loyal and coming back for repeat purchases. These are highly valuable customers who frequently shop in high AOV,” he boasted. On the long-term roadmap, Ole wants to launch a live chat capability for users to contact customer service reps and get styling recommendations and assistance. It also wants to integrate AI-powered personalized recommendations. Hendelman founded the company in 2021 with his longtime friend, Gal Aharon (CMO). They previously started Engie together, a car diagnostics app and mechanic marketplace. His cousin Omer Hendelman (COO), former vice president of operations at delivery startup Avo, is also on the founding team. Hendelman and his wife conceptualized the idea for Ole when ordering food on a delivery app. “[My] wife asked, ‘How come I can get a burger in 25 minutes, yet if I am ordering from the boutique store around the corner, it takes days to arrive?’ That made us see the gap and opportunity in fashion shopping,” Hendelman remarked. “While every other segment made huge advancements with on-demand deliveries — pharmaceuticals, food, groceries — fashion has not changed.

They’ve been at the helm of MadaLuxe Group, a luxury distribution platform for fashion and accessories, since 1990. Now they’re adding AI-powered virtual try-on and styling technology to the list. Today, the pair launched Zelig, offering personalized technology that will eventually enable consumers to upload a photo to visualize how clothes, shoes and accessories look on their body type as they shop online. At launch, consumers can choose between more than 40 models of diverse body types, skin tones and hair colors.

San Francisco | October 13-15, 2026 WAITLIST NOW She explained that nowhere else can a shopper see themselves through the entire shopping journey. “So many people, when we did our UX testing, forgot why they even picked certain styles out at the very beginning by the time they’re finished with our shopping experience, so we thought that would be a really cool thing,” Sholl said. “We have created hyper personalization that is driven by your customers’ actual engagement. It’s a competitive advantage for today, but absolutely a necessity for tomorrow.” Sholl likened Zelig’s potential to those of enterprise customer relationship management tools Snowflake and Salesforce, noting, “they’re basically just taking the data and putting it into reporting for tomorrow. We are willing to advance this technology into a visual reporting tool, and we think it’s just the wave of the future in the next decade.” Sholl and Freede privately funded Zelig for the past three years, however, now they announce $15 million in Series A funding that values the pre-revenue company at $100 million. Financial services firm Hilco Global led the funding round, joined by global luxury investor Bezikian Zareh. “Sandy Sholl and Adam Freede are innovators in the luxury fashion business with whom I’ve had success with on previous investments, and Hilco Global is proud to be partnering with them again,” Jeffrey Hecktman, CEO of Hilco Global, said in a written statement. “While many tech companies are building solutions for an industry they don’t know well, Zelig was founded by fashion experts with firsthand knowledge of how to solve the retail industry’s biggest challenges.” Zelig intends to deploy the capital into technology development around its personalization capabilities and to build out additional features. Sholl declined to name any brands with the launch of Zelig. However, with MadaLuxe repping merchandise from brands, including Versace, Gucci and Cartier, it’s probably not a stretch to suggest some of these retailers — or the large department stores where they are sold — are likely to sign on in the future.

This is getting harder because there are now many distribution channels, more complex supply chains, and shorter sales cycles. Mid-market retailers and premium brands have less firepower than the retail giants and tend to rely on legacy software. Founded in 2020, Autone aims to forecast demand, and aid sales, while cutting waste and manual tasks. The company has now raised a $17 million Series A funding round, led by General Catalyst. Previous investors also participated, including Speedinvest, Y Combinator, Seedcamp, 2100 Ventures, Motier, Financière Saint James, and angels from LVMH, Sephora, and Moncler. The new funding takes the total raised for the company to $20 million, including a $3 million seed round led by Speedinvest. Its competitors include Anaplan, Blue Yonder, and Relex. Born and raised in Paris, Autone co-founder and CEO Adil Bouhdadi (pictured above, right) first got into sneaker culture in the early 2000s. Later, he wanted to enter the luxury fashion business, but with few connections, he decided to incessantly refresh the LVMH career website until an internship at Givenchy came up. He ended up spending six months shadowing the CEO. After a Masters’ Degree in 2013, he got a break at Alexander Wang in New York, moved to Victoria Beckham in London, and joined Alexander McQueen in 2015. While there, Bouhdadi and colleague Harry Glucksmann-Cheslaw (now Autone CTO) both worked on an internal inventory platform which, they claim, helped the brand’s revenue increase substantially over the following five years. The co-founders are a Muslim and Jewish pairing. Bouhdadi comes from a Muslim family (his parents moved to Paris from Morocco) and his co-founder comes from a Jewish family who moved to the U.K. to escape the Holocaust. Bouhdadi (now CEO) told TechCrunch: “At Alexander McQueen we realized everyone in the company was just literally using Excel. The biggest pain point for any retail company is that they all operate in silos.

    "extractedText": "A new luxury goods e-commerce startup dubbed Long Story Short has a provocative concept: it’s $1,000 per month to join for the privilege of shopping its curated collection. Shocking as that sounds, founder Joseph Einhorn believes he understands this sliver of the e-commerce market, and why many online luxury ventures to date have failed to work. The founder, known best for his 2010s e-commerce site The Fancy, an upscale shoppable Pinterest rival, says high-net-worth individuals demand more in terms of privacy and security from their online experience — something that shopping a luxury marketplace often does not provide. At Long Story Short, the private shopping club takes a different approach than other shopping sites. In addition to simply needing to have the funds to pay its $1,000 per month fee, potential customers must apply for acceptance. Once in, the customers can shop from the site’s 50,000 hand-selected luxury products, spanning categories like home décor, luxury apparel, art, cards, jewelry, watches, gadgets, and more, or they can request the LSS (Long Story Short) team to procure items on their behalf. Image Credits: Long Story ShortImage Credits:Long Story Short The value proposition — if such a word can be used for such a costly service — is that LSS will manage the transaction on the customer’s behalf. That means negotiating with vendors and sellers, acquiring the item, then inspecting and verifying the item for authenticity, before shipping it to the buyer. This allows the customer’s transactions to remain anonymous to the seller — something that’s prized among high-net-worth individuals due to the security risks involved with having their name, address, or phone number compromised. While LSS will have this information, Einhorn’s experience in e-commerce means he’s already familiar with the world of online fraud and how to combat it and has built the new company with an eye on privacy. The company won’t detail its security practices so as to not invite hackers but notes that it trades security for convenience in some cases by not collecting or storing anything but necessary info. In addition, some of its systems aren’t even connected to the web. Image Credits: Long Story ShortImage Credits:Long Story Short The concept of a private shopping club is something that Einhorn likens to other efforts in catering to high-net-worth individuals, as with Pharrell’s launch of his own auction house last year, Joopiter. And, similar to offline luxury retail, LSS aims to provide the white-glove service that luxury shoppers expect. Plus, Einhorn argues that subscribing to LSS makes sense for anyone already spending at least $1,000 per month on luxury goods because of the savings it delivers. Today’s online marketplaces are often heavily marketing up their items, which means people are paying “at least $1,000” by being overcharged on “marketplace waste,” he argues.

And then, number two, let us get the best possible price, rather than just logging on somewhere everybody is being drawn into the same kind of marked-up overpriced item,” Einhorn explains. He believes that the combination of eliminating the marketplace fees and establishing direct relationships with vendors and sellers, LSS’s savings could reduce the cost of luxury items by 20% to 40%. However, his thesis has not yet been tested, as the site is only now launching. “What we hope is that by having this collective buying power of serious spenders — like serious shoppers — that we as a group will unlock better terms for everybody,” Einhorn says. LSS, meanwhile, doesn’t mark up the items itself nor charge any other fees beyond the (pricey) subscription.

    "extractedText": "TikTok Shop, TikTok’s social commerce marketplace, is launching a secondhand luxury category in the U.K., putting it in closer competition with The RealReal, Vestiaire Collective, Depop, Poshmark, and Mercari, among others. The offering has already existed in TikTok Shop U.S. for over six months. The new category allows customers in the U.K. to purchase pre-owned high-end clothing, designer handbags, and other accessories, all without leaving the TikTok app. At launch, only five U.K. brands are available, including Sellier, Luxe Collective, Sign of the Times, HardlyEverWornIt, and Break Archive. Since launching TikTok Shop in 2022, the platform has sold around $1 billion or more worth of products. However, despite its success, some argue that TikTok Shop is ruining the short-form video-sharing app, claiming fakes and poor-quality products are flooding the marketplace. Counterfeits are the biggest risk when buying pre-owned luxury goods online, with even the largest e-commerce giants (Amazon, eBay, and others) facing authenticity issues. Like all resale marketplaces, TikTok Shop has an anti-counterfeit policy that guarantees a full refund if a seller is proven to have sold a counterfeit product. Bloomberg recently reported that the company is in talks with luxury goods company LVMH to help crack down on counterfeiting. All secondhand brands on TikTok Shop U.S. are required to have certificates from third-party authenticators. TikTok partnered with authentication services Entrupy and Real Authentication to ensure that designer handbags on the platform are genuine. Meanwhile, a TikTok spokesperson told TechCrunch that the five U.K. brands all have their own in-house authentication process. They wouldn’t say when it would begin accepting other secondhand brands.

San Francisco | October 13-15, 2026 WAITLIST NOW The launch of TikTok Shop’s secondhand luxury category is a strategic move to tap into the growing market of preowned luxury items. The secondhand luxury market is a thriving multibillion-dollar business, with an estimated $49.3 billion (€45 billion) worth of secondhand designer items sold worldwide in 2023. Additionally, this expansion aligns with the increasing trend of people embracing preloved fashion, and it opens up new avenues for secondhand brands in the U.K. to reach a wider customer base. The popularity of secondhand fashion on TikTok is evident, with over 144,000 TikTok posts using the hashtag #secondhandfashion, which has garnered approximately 1.2 billion views. Today’s announcement arrives on the heels of the U.S. House of Representatives passing a bill that requires ByteDance to sell TikTok or face a ban in the U.S., a bill that appears to be gaining support in the Senate. A ban would be a serious blow to American merchants selling on the app. According to the company, the short video-sharing app generated $14.7 billion for small- to midsize businesses in 2023.

    "extractedText": "eBay on Tuesday launched a new generative AI-powered feature to appeal to fashion enthusiasts: a “shop the look” section within its iOS mobile app that will suggest a carousel of images and ideas, based on the customer’s shopping history. The company says its recommendations will be personalized to the end user and will evolve as the customer shops more. The idea is to introduce how other fashion items may complement their current wardrobe. To do so, “shop the look” will include interactive hotspots that, when tapped, will reveal similar items and outfit inspirations, with the resulting looks including both preowned and luxury items that match the user’s personal style. The feature is powered by eBay.ai, and was developed in collaboration with the company’s Responsible AI team and RAI Principles, eBay notes. Image Credits: eBay “Shop the look” will appear to any eBay shopper who has viewed at least 10 fashion items over the past 180 days, the company notes. It will display both on the eBay homepage and the fashion landing page. For eBay, the addition offers a way to showcase its wide expanse of inventory available for sale differently than before — and one that could potentially encourage more sales, if successful. eBay says it plans to explore expansions to other categories over time and will continue adding more personalization elements to the feature over the new year. eBay isn’t the only one exploring how AI can improve the fashion shopping experience. Google last summer introduced a way for consumers to virtually try on clothes using a new AI shopping feature, for example. Amazon has also turned to AI to help customers find clothes that fit when shopping online. In those cases, the AI features were meant to help customers find the right fit or size, whereas eBay’s new feature is more focused on fashion inspiration — meaning finding the right style. That can be harder to do, given that personal style is subjective. “Shop the look” will initially be available on iOS in the U.S. and U.K., with support for Android coming later this year.

    "extractedText": "When Lexi Willetts and Marina Pengilly realized they could make as much as £30,000 a year reselling their luxury clothes and accessories online, they resolved to create a solution for modern women who are already well-versed in the behaviors of Instagram and the sharing economy. Their solution, Little Black Door, has just gone live on the iOS store, and allows women to see, style and share their wardrobes with friends and followers. It also connects them to resale platforms, unlocking a vastly more environmental-friendly and sustainable way to shop for high-quality fashion. And with the COVID-19 pandemic hitting the fashion world, the app is set to benefit, as consumers head to the re-sale of luxury, rather than new items. As Willetts puts it: “This started as a response to our own bad wardrobe behaviors. Our overbuying often because we forgot what we had, often thinking to buy rather than borrow from friends. Plus, we saw the headache of creating resale listings. Realizing that so much of our interactions were online, thus producing very rich e-receipt data, we set about thinking how we could make use of that to create better wardrobe engagement and reduce our overbuying of irrelevant, cheap fashion.” The problem with platforms like this has always been: how to digitize the wardrobe in the first place. Most people can’t be bothered to go to the trouble. But this app takes a fresh approach. It concentrates on using wardrobe purchase data and leveraging social sharing behavior to more easily create a digital wardrobe. It also allows the wardrobe to be connected with retail, making it far easier to start the resale journey of selling unwanted items. The resulting LBD app appears at first to be a sort of “Instagram and Depop” mashup. Users add items to their virtual wardrobe, which then employs image recognition AI and natural language processing to figure out what the item is, and tries to categorize it as well. It checks with the user if something is a t-shirt, black, short sleeve, minimalism, urban casual, etc. before it’s confirmed into the wardrobe.

San Francisco | October 13-15, 2026 WAITLIST NOW But perhaps more interestingly, the LBD app will ingest receipts of items purchased via email. This means the wardrobe can be built up from new or existing data the user already has. Once the wardrobe is built inside the app, the user can see the clothes and categories, their total wardrobe spend, and create “lookbooks” which they can share with friends and followers to comment on. Friends can then borrow items or users can send items to resale via the “swipe to sell” feature. Most other wardrobe apps haven’t created a “viral loop” whereby the user is incentivized to use the app daily. LBD has added social features to create a community-driven platform that is almost like an “Instagram for fashion”. Previous “wardrobe apps” like this have obsessed over whether the app can recognize clothes or not, but most don’t work well. The better use of AI, as LBD has realized, is to use receipts data and purchase histories, plus retail partner links, to add to wardrobes. This means the wardrobe upload feature isn’t the primary focus, as it is trumped by wardrobe item data. It’s on this basis that they can create more useful and — crucially — playful features. “We’ve designed features to entertain and engage the user relating to their wardrobe. We create ease of sharing with friends, tapping into the sharing economy mindset… Moreover, the app is designed to build a culture of conscious consumption, encouraging users to buy less ‘fast fashion’, invest in quality pieces and wear and share the contents of their closets,” says Willetts. So the app is interesting, but what about the business model? Effectively, LBD is creating a data play around women’s wardrobes. They could use the data to create advertising for relevant and sustainable brands; partnerships with retailers; value-added services; a resale platform with commissions; verified sellers; and a premium version for hig",

    "extractedText": "Shopping for clothing online has liberated us from the need to brave the endless aisles, fluorescent lights and sale-hungry crowds of the brick-and-mortar retail inferno. But anyone who has found themselves two hours deep into a fashion rabbit hole, with nothing to show for it but 15 open tabs, four full shopping carts, an earful of YouTube clothing haul reviews and the gnawing anxiety of the overwhelmed, shopping online can feel like a chore. Enter Blend, a U.K.-based startup that is using AI to cut through the noise and help shoppers find personalized product recommendations to suit their style, budget and size. “The vast majority of retailers do absolutely no personalization, and in the instances when they do, they only personalize according to historic purchase data,” Blend co-founder Jemima Bunbury told TechCrunch. “When trends are changing relatively quickly, and people’s style does change over the course of their lives, it doesn’t stay relevant for a user to have such historic recommendations.” Blend participated in TechCrunch Disrupt 2023 as one of the Startup Battlefield 200 companies. At the event, the startup launched its MVP — an app that will slowly open to the 2,000 users on Blend’s waiting list. After raising angel investment in April, Blend is now on the hunt to secure investors for its seed round. The startup will use those funds to build out additional features on the app and push for a full-scale launch. Blend has already signed on over 250 retailers, including Net-a-Porter, a luxury retailer. The startup’s go-to-market strategy targets users aged 18 to 34, “very digital, native mobile-first shoppers” who are starting to define their personal style as they accrue disposable income. Blend is launching in the U.K. first and then hopes to move into the U.S. market. “We hope that by attracting first the very fashion-forward, trendsetting crowd, we can then move more mainstream from there, but it’s much more difficult to go the other way round,” said Bunbury. “Ultimately, the vision is really to be the front door for every online shopping experience, and therefore, to be the largest-scale retailer because of that ability to personalize and only present people with the 1% of the internet that is most relevant to them.” Generative AI we can get behind Blend co-founders Bella Levin (left), Jemima Bunbury (middle) and Eva Piskova (right).

Some companies are using natural language processing algorithms to improve the customer service experience. Others are using image generation to create new designs.

San Francisco | October 13-15, 2026 WAITLIST NOW Blend’s approach centers around transformer technology and recommendation algorithms, powered in large part by user interaction data. Transformer technology, which makes up the tech stack of popular generative AI models like ChatGPT, is a model for teaching computers how to understand and generate human language. In the world of fashion, this means it can better understand user preferences and make tailored clothing recommendations. “The main thing that’s always important when it comes to AI is what data you are actually putting into [the model],” said Bunbury, noting that the founding team decided on an app rather than a web page in part because it’s easier to track a user’s data that way. When the user opens the app, they’ll scroll through a feed that is a mix of product imagery and descriptions that have been pulled from different retail and e-commerce sites. Their feed will also feature short-form videos and product curations from influencers who can earn an affiliate commission on any sales they generate. As the user scrolls, Blend collects data on how they interact with the app, whether they’re liking products, saving them, sharing with a friend, “or simply how long you’re looking at one product,” according to Bunbury. Blend uses all of that data",

Creators can design anything from clothing, high-end handbags and other accessories to decor, furniture, electronics and more. Users vote on their favorites, and the Montreal-based startup leads the funding, manufacturing and shipping for the most popular designs. A product design must have at least 100 votes to be considered, we’re told. Off/Script also evaluates the complexity of the project, cost of production and how much inventory to order based on demand. Off/Script’s generative AI design studio helps anyone produce product mock-ups, regardless of whether they are an expert designer or not. Off/Script’s studio leverages the generative AI model Stable Diffusion, which the company has tailored for poses, variations and scalability. It also uses ControlNet — an open network protocol to control image generation in Stable Diffusion — to show 360-degree images of the items. Creators can either enter a custom prompt into the generator or select from premade product templates to be customized to their liking. Off/Script has created a library of customizable clothing and accessories from its network of manufacturers, including trousers, knitted sweaters, raincoats, hoodies, t-shirts, swimsuits, duffle bags, bucket hats and more. This gives creators a starting point that is actually feasible to make because it’s already been done before. AI-generated fashion has existed for years and has since become a popular tool among designers. Design and production tool CALA — which has been around since 2016 — recently implemented OpenAI’s DALL-E API. Off/Script aims to be among the first companies to bridge the gap between generative AI, user-generated designs and tangible products.

San Francisco | October 13-15, 2026 WAITLIST NOW “The studio is optional,” said Massicotte. “Experienced designers can submit concepts created on platforms like Photoshop and others if they prefer. We see the Studio as a great tool for idea exploration and helping creators across skill levels share their ideas with the world in a beautiful way.” Image Credits: Off/Script Off/Script works with an ecosystem of over 1,000 manufacturers to bring the concepts to life, including a company called Crease Group that works with brands such as Kevin Hart’s Gran Coramino tequila, Pure Barre, Rumble Boxing and Club Pilates. “A long-term vision is we might enable [manufacturers] to take on projects themselves directly from the portal. This way, more creators see their things being built,” Brun revealed to us. He also said that Off/Script wants to find local manufacturers so creators can create and sell in their own country to “promote the local economy.” Creators take home 20% of the sales, along with a $500 upfront fee. They can also sell the item on their own website or online marketplace like Shopify. There are currently 30 beta-phase products for sale on Off/Script’s website and app. Items range from clothing and sneakers to athleisure and luxury items made by popular designers such as AI artists Field Skjellerup (@ai_clothingdaily) and Alycia Rainaud (@maalavidaa), as well as famous MMA coach Firas Zahabi. “In just a few months, and prior to even having the app live, we’ve helped our creators earn thousands of dollars from their concepts,” Brun claimed. Off/Script says it wants to be the highest-paying app ever for its creator community. Puffer Jacket design by Maalavidaa. Image Credits: Off/Script Despite the controversy toward AI art, Off/Script believes there are some AI artists who have their own style and original concepts. “[Saying] there is no creativity or it’s copying is disconnected from the reality of it when you look at the AI art and what some people aren’t capable of doing with their own touch and ",

    "extractedText": "The world of fashion is moving at a faster pace each year. Most retailers introduce new styles each season, and fast-fashion companies like Shein, H&M, and Zara update their collections continuously. To keep pace with the rapid demand for new styles, brands and manufacturers have been turning to tech to accelerate their design process. Raspberry AI, a startup founded two years ago, is one of the technological solutions that helps expedite product development by allowing designers to visualize and iterate their ideas nearly instantly with its text-to-image platform. Rasberry’s founder Cheryl Liu, who was a private equity analyst at KKR focused on retail before working for Amazon and DoorDash, spotted an opportunity to apply generative AI to fashion design right after image models like Open AI’s DALL-E and Stability AI‘s stable diffusion became available in late 2022. “For the first time in history, you could rapidly create hundreds of designs in a way that you could never do before,” Liu told TechCrunch. She explained that before generative AI, designers would often have to order physical samples to visualize their ideas, which would take weeks. The other alternative was to use older computer-aided design tools like Browzwear and Adobe’s Photoshop. But with Raspberry designers can turn their sketches into photo-realistic images just as they would appear on the brand’s website. Those images can help brands decide if they want to manufacture the product, according to Liu. “You can see the same foundational piece in a lot of different materials and prints,” she said. “No company is going to order 50 different sample iterations for one single product, but now they can see 50 different iterations of a single design.” Techcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Today, Raspberry counts 70 customers, including fashion houses like athletic brand Under Armour, Gruppo Teddy, an Italian manufacturer with 8,840 stores across 39 countries, and luxury designer MCM Worldwide. Such fast growth has helped Raspberry raise a $24 million Series A led by Andreessen Horowitz, with the participation of existing investors Greycroft, Correlation Ventures, and MVP Ventures. The funding comes about 10 months after the startup’s $4.5 million seed round. Image Credits:Raspberry AI Andreessen Horowitz was interested in investing in an AI company that can accelerate the fashion manufacturing process, said Bryan Kim, a partner at the firm. “We had met with multiple companies and got excited about Cheryl as a founder and how she approaches building a company.” Of course, it also helped that Raspberry has “marquee clients that are very, very large and important,” Kim added. While Liu acknowledged that Raspberry competes with other AI image generators like Midjourney, DALL-E, and Adobe Firefly, a key reason why professional designers choose her company’s product is its ability to understand and accurately interpret industry-specific terminology. She gave an example of the word “fuzzy sweater.” She explained: “There’s a lot of terminology behind that sweater that a Midjourney does not know.” Another design-specific feature that Raspberry offers is the ability to create images from sketches. Raspberry will use the funding to hire engineering, sales, and marketing professionals and expand into home, furniture, and cosmetics product design. TechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

The company on Monday also introduced a new feature called “Match My Room,” which allows users to upload a photo of their room so their design complements the existing colors and style. Alongside this expansion, Arcade announced its $25 million Series A funding round, bringing the total amount raised to $42 million. Similar to Arcade’s jewelry design generator, the rug creation tool leverages Midjourney and Stable Diffusion. Users select the rug material and then enter a text prompt to describe the desired design. Once the design is generated, it’s then paired with a manufacturer, who will send the creator a free sample for approval before purchasing. Based on our testing, rugs start at around $400 for a 3×9 hand-tufted wool option, which is the most affordable material. Prices increase for higher-end materials such as cashmere, alpaca, and mohair. However, Arcade claims to offer more affordable options than luxury rug retailers that charge thousands of dollars. Image Credits:Arcade The “Match My Room” feature allows users to upload a photo of their space. While the AI analyzes color matching, it can’t successfully replicate patterns from other decor items in the image, like pillows and blankets. Overall, though, it’s a useful tool for ensuring the rug’s color accents tie in with other furniture. For users looking to create designs for pure enjoyment, Arcade offers “Dream Boards,” which function similarly to Pinterest boards, showcasing products with similar themes, such as Hollywood-inspired earrings. Users can also browse other Dream Boards and make purchases.

Users can earn even more by joining Arcade’s affiliate program. The company recently launched a new entrepreneur program aimed at helping content creators unlock higher commission rates. Major media outlets and influencers with over 25,000 followers are encouraged to sign up by emailing Arcade’s marketing team. Despite launching its beta jewelry offering only in September 2024, Arcade claims to have generated 650,000 jewelry designs. But the company didn’t disclose how many users are interested in purchasing these designs, nor has it revealed the commission earnings of sellers. Arcade is spearheaded by Mariam Naficy, who previously founded cosmetics retailer Eve and design marketplace Minted. The Series A round was led by Laura Chau (Canaan Partners), with participation from Kirsten Green (Forerunner), April Underwood (Adverb Ventures), and Sol Bier (Factorial Funds). The new capital will be allocated toward hiring, platform development, and introducing new product categories like ceramics and pillows. Naficy has previously mentioned to TechCrunch that additional categories may include apparel and leather goods. According to its website, chain belts are also next. Arcade previously raised $17 million from Ashton Kutcher (Sound Ventures), Offline Ventures, and Reid Hoffman (LinkedIn co-founder).

    "extractedText": "In case you haven’t heard, 3D printing has entered the mainstream, and it will disrupt every industry’s manufacturing processes slightly differently. Let’s talk about why it will work in fashion. 3D printing is not entirely new to the fashion industry, as jewelry designers have for years outsourced quick modeling jobs to printing companies. But as 3D-printed pieces begin to pop up on the runway and in presentations outside of fashion week as the finished product, it’s worth asking why the method stands a chance of proliferating among designers. It looks damn good. Catherine Wales, a designer trained in classic garment cutting at Yves Saint Laurent and Emanuel Ungaro, is currently exhibiting a collection of masks, corsets and helmets at the Arnhem Mode Biennale in the Netherlands. Designers Francis Bitonti and Michael Schmidt collaborated with Shapeways to produce a 3D-printed gown modeled by the burlesque icon Dita Von Teese at a presentation in February. The results are beautiful. Comprising 3,000 articulated joints and dotted with 12,000 Swarovski crystals, Dita’s gown fits her curves like a glittering Chinese finger trap. Wales’s feathered shoulder piece fluffs and falls like the real thing. This is art. It isn’t wearable, but it suggests that 3D printing has the finesse necessary to break into an industry known for its attention to quality craft.

Printers are getting closer to producing good fabric-like materials, using interlocking structures to create weaves and stitches. Duann Scott, Shapeways‘ “Designer Evangelist,” said that once more fashion designers start using 3D printing, it will make a case for 3D manufacturers to develop more breathable, wearable materials. This is, of course, a chicken and egg situation, as designers aren’t going to want to migrate to 3D printing until they know it’s as good if not better than their current methods. At the moment, 3D printing may be most compelling to designers when used in conjunction with organic materials. Bitonti told me that he’s currently working on 3D-printed handbags finished with stingray leather, an idea that has a lot of potential. Designers and consumers have a strong historical and emotional affinity to non-synthetic materials like leather, silk and cotton, and they aren’t going anywhere. It wouldn’t be surprising to see designers incorporating complex printed elements with traditional materials in the near future. It could save young designers. If 3D printing disrupts mass fashion production, it will do so because it will have become cheaper and more efficient than current manufacturing methods. Ready-to-wear, however, with its smaller production runs, financial insecurity and impulse toward the artistic, is the ideal space for 3D printing to take root now. The designer Kimberly Ovitz, who showed a small range of Shapeways-printed nylon jewelry with her ready-to-wear collection at New York Fashion Week in February, said that 3D printing revolutionized her production timetable. Consumers could buy the jewelry immediately after her show and receive the product in two weeks. “I found that there are so many benefits for small designers. You don’t have to deal with minimum or volume issues. You can design as many prototypes as you want as intricately as you want, and it doesn’t affect anything the way it does with clothes.” For small, young brands, which have a failure rate not unlike tech startups, 3D printing offers the previously unheard-of option to manufacture exactly to order. In a world where botched manufacturing runs and over-estimated interest in an item leads to unusable and unsold stock, printing minimizes risk in a way that never existed before for fashion designers. It can find a happy medium with handmade. One of the obvious challenges facing mainstream adoption of 3D printing in the clothing industry is a longstanding appreciation for handcrafted pieces. Would a Birkin bag cost as much as it does if it were not stitched by human hands? Scott argues that t",

How I learned to stop worrying and love AI slop —Caiwei Chen If I were to locate the moment AI slop broke through into popular consciousness, I’d pick the video of rabbits bouncing on a trampoline that went viral last summer. For many savvy internet users, myself included, it was the first time we were fooled by an AI video, and it ended up spawning a wave of almost identical generated clips. My first reaction was that, broadly speaking, all of this sucked. That’s become a familiar refrain, in think pieces and at dinner parties. Everything online is slop now—the internet “enshittified,” with AI taking much of the blame. Initially, I largely agreed. But then friends started sharing AI clips in group chats that were compellingly weird, or funny. Some even had a grain of brilliance. I had to admit I didn’t fully understand what I was rejecting—what I found so objectionable. To try to get to the bottom of how I felt (and why), I spoke to the people making the videos, a company creating bespoke tools for creators, and experts who study how new media becomes culture. What I found convinced me that maybe generative AI will not end up ruining everything after all. Read the full story. A new CRISPR startup is betting regulators will ease up on gene-editingHere at MIT Technology Review we’ve been writing about the gene-editing technology CRISPR since 2013, calling it the biggest biotech breakthrough of the century. Yet so far, there’s been only one gene-editing drug approved, and it’s been used commercially on only about 40 patients, all with sickle-cell disease.It’s becoming clear that the impact of CRISPR isn’t as big as we all hoped. In fact, there’s a pall of discouragement over the entire field—with some journalists saying the gene-editing revolution has “lost its mojo.”So what will it take for CRISPR to help more people? A new startup says the answer could be an “umbrella approach” to testing and commercializing treatments which could avoid costly new trials or approvals for every new version. Read the full story. —Antonio Regalado America’s new dietary guidelines ignore decades of scientific research The first days of 2026 have brought big news for health. On Wednesday, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his colleagues at the Departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture unveiled new dietary guidelines for Americans. And they are causing a bit of a stir.That’s partly because they recommend products like red meat, butter, and beef tallow—foods that have been linked to cardiovascular disease, and that nutrition experts have been recommending people limit in their diets.These guidelines are a big deal—they influence food assistance programs and school lunches, for example.

SmartThings won the Dublin Web Summit startup competition this week beating off the other three finalists Vibease, Ovelin and Tictail and winning €100,000 in cash, as part of the Electric Ireland Spark of Genius competition. Over 1,000 entries to the competition were shortlisted to 100 which then pitched from two stages (social, mobile, consumer and enterprise) to over the two day international tech conference. Set up by Alex Hawkinson, SmartThings turns everyday objects into smart objects. The platform is a hub that connects to the internet and other devices that then senses and controls real-world things like a door lock, or a light or anything else. This is along the lines of the Internet of things we’ve heard so much about. It previously secured $1.2 million in a Kickstarter campaign and has announced a partnership with Instacube which will allows the cube to display notifications for things like visitors arriving or leaving the lights on. It’ll also be able to control home automation systems that SmartThings can operate. The other startups in the final were: VIBEASE INC. Dema Tio, Singapore Their pitch: Vibease helps couples to stay intimate by using app and personal massager. “Vibease is a private social network app for couples with Bluetooth personal massager. Couples can use Vibease for chatting and share their moments. The woman’s partner can control her massager using a smartphone, even though they are separated. One of the top reasons for divorce is a lack of sexual intimacy in a relationship, especially in long distance relationships. With Vibease, distance doesn’t matter.” OVELIN Chris Thür Finland Their pitch: Guitar Hero for real guitar! Get hooked on practicing on your real instrument. Ovelin is changing the way how people learn to play a musical instru- ment. Our first game WildChords is played with a real guitar on the iPad (no special equipment needed). The guitar learning game has won numerous awards including best European learning game, iPad game of the year, Sunday Times award and was #1 music app in 34 countries. TICTAIL Carl Waldekranz Sweden Start a free and beautiful online store and get daily marketing advice. Their pitch: Called “The Tumblr of e-commerce” by Wired Magazine, Tictail offers a free and easy way to start your own online store. Since beta-launch in May 2012, Tictail has been named one of top 100 startups in Europe (Wired) and the hottest startup in Sweden (IDG) and have already gained traction amongst thousands of online retailers all around the world.

    "extractedText": "After launching a generative AI tool for corporate employees in August, Walmart is bringing the technology to its customers. During a demo with TechCrunch, a company spokesperson outlined how the retail giant is experimenting with generative AI to help shoppers in all stages of the shopping experience, from the search and discovery phase to making a purchase. Three features coming down the pipeline include a shopping assistant, generative AI-powered search and an interior design feature. Walmart declined to share which AI models it’s using to develop these features, but says it’s using a variety of different external models and they may change over time. “Other companies are essentially locking themselves into working with Anthropic or OpenAI,” the spokesperson told us. “We want to have that flexibility to put in and out different models.” Image Credits: Walmart The new shopping assistant — which is launching in the coming weeks — will allow customers to have a more interactive and conversational experience as it can answer specific questions, provide personalized product suggestions and share detailed information about a certain product. For instance, it can give shoppers Halloween costume ideas to wear to a horror-themed party or which cell phone a parent should buy for their child. Similarly, users will soon be able to enter specific questions directly in the search bar. With the use of generative AI, Walmart’s search tool can understand context and generate a collection of items relevant to one query. For example, if a customer wants to plan for a unicorn-themed birthday, the AI displays a wide array of products such as balloons, paper napkins, streamers and so on. Instead of having to type in numerous separate searches, Walmart’s new AI search tool is designed to save customers time. We also see this being done by other companies like Instacart, which recently rolled out a ChatGPT-powered search tool that can generate suggestions like a selection of high-protein foods or Thanksgiving dinner ideas. Plus, Meta announced a new Bing-backed AI Assistant last month as well as an AI personality chatbot, among other tools. Image Credits: Walmart Walmart is also developing an interior design assistant for customers to decorate their rooms. In addition to generative AI, the feature also leverages AR technology; users must upload a photo of a room and it will then take an image capture of every item that’s in the space. Customers ask the chat assistant for advice on how they should redecorate, and the AI places items in the room that they suggest. Users can express their opinions on which items they want to keep or buy. The AI also asks for a budget so it can find items that are affordable.

San Francisco | October 13-15, 2026 WAITLIST NOW The continued investment in generative AI tools is a common theme these days as more companies rush to integrate the technology into their products and services. “Generative AI technology is a priority for the company,” said the Walmart spokesperson. The new tools come on the heels of Walmart rolling out its AI app, “My Assistant,” to 50,000 corporate employees in the U.S. to streamline tasks like summarizing documents, helping prep for meetings and speeding up projects. Walmart has been getting “great feedback” about the app and even found some employees using the assistant to draft “funny out-of-office messages,” the spokesperson added.

    "extractedText": "Amazon today introduced a new set of generative AI tools aimed at sellers which the retailer says will simplify the process of creating product listings. The retail giant claims these new capabilities are designed to help sellers generate “captivating product descriptions, titles, and listing details.” Sellers will also be able to add to their existing product descriptions using AI, instead of having to start from scratch. The AI tools were built using large language models, or LLMs, that were trained on large amounts of data. Though Amazon doesn’t specifically say, it seems that the retailer likely scoured its own listing data to train its machine learning models. Previously, Amazon had used machine learning and deep learning techniques to extract and enrich product information, but the new generation AI capabilities builds on that technology. “With our new generative AI models, we can infer, improve, and enrich product knowledge at an unprecedented scale and with dramatic improvement in quality, performance, and efficiency,” explained Robert Tekiela, vice president of Amazon Selection and Catalog Systems, in a statement. “Our models learn to infer product information through the diverse sources of information, latent knowledge, and logical reasoning that they learn. For example, they can infer a table is round if specifications list a diameter or infer the collar style of a shirt from its image.” Amazon claims that its generative AI tools will help sellers save time and allow customers to find more complete product information, but there are some concerns around using generative AI models at such scale, given their ability to “hallucinate” — or create false information not based on real data. The tools could also potentially contain other mistakes that aren’t caught if a human doesn’t review the output. And if the tools end up creating incorrect product listings and descriptions, Amazon could be held liable — particularly if it doesn’t disclose the listing was created using AI. The Information previously reported Amazon was piloting generative AI tools for content, noting that the tool warns sellers to double-check the content to ensure it complies with Amazon’s listing guidelines. The company had declined to answer questions about the LLMs it was using for the new tool, the report had said.

    "extractedText": "In a keynote address at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Walmart president and CEO Doug McMillon and other Walmart execs offered a glimpse as to how the retail giant was putting new technologies, including augmented reality (AR), drones, generative AI and other artificial intelligence tech to work in order improve the shopping experience for customers. At the trade show, the company revealed a handful of new products, including two AI-powered tools for managing product search and replenishment, as well as a new beta AR social commerce platform called “Shop with Friends.” It also highlighted how it was using AI in other areas of its business, including within Sam’s Club and in apps used by store associates. Most notably, Walmart is launching a new generative AI search feature on iOS that will allow customers to search for products by use cases, instead of by product or brand names. For example, you could ask Walmart to return search results for things needed for a “football watch party,” instead of specifically typing in searches for chips, wings, drinks or a 90-inch TV. These enhanced search results will span categories, rivaling Google’s SGE (Search Generative Experience), which can recommend products and show various factors to consider, along with reviews, prices, images and more. Image Credits: Walmart Ahead of CES, the company had demonstrated an AI shopping assistant that would let customers interact with a chatbot as they shopped, to ask questions and receive personalized product suggestions, as well. At the time, Walmart teased that a generative AI-powered search feature was also in the works. It suggested customers could ask for things like a “unicorn-themed birthday party” and get results like unicorn-themed napkins, balloons, streamers and more. Now the feature is rolling out on mobile devices, iOS first. Another potentially promising use of AI involves the replenishment of frequently ordered items. Walmart will initially test this use case with Walmart InHome Replenishment, which will use AI and its existing replenishment expertise combined to create automated online shopping carts for customers with items they regularly order. Because it’s only available through the InHome program, these items are then delivered to a customer’s fridge in their kitchen or garage using the smart lock-powered InHome delivery service, but it will not be a subscription service. The company also noted that customers will be able to remove items from their basket, as needed, and the service will adjust to customer’s changing needs over time.

San Francisco | October 13-15, 2026 WAITLIST NOW Image Credits: Walmart However, if the feature works well, it’s not hard to imagine how it could be put to use to offer replenishment of other household items as well, similar to Amazon’s Subscribe-and-Save. Surprisingly, Amazon has not yet leveraged AI to do the same (i.e. to augment or replace Dash Replenishment). However, the online retailer has been putting AI to work in other ways, including by helping connect customers with the right product by summarizing product reviews, highlighting key attributes or helping them find clothes that fit. Image Credits: Walmart Another new Walmart product making a debut at CES is “Shop with Friends,” an AR shopping tool that lets customers share virtual outfits they create with their friends and then get feedback on their finds. The tool combines Walmart’s AI-powered virtual try-on tech, launched last year, with social features. Image Credits: Walmart CEO Doug McMillon referred to the suite of new products as something he called “adaptive retail” — that is, retail experiences that are personalized and flexible. “While omnichannel retail has been around for decades, this new type of retail — adaptive retail — takes it a step further, said Suresh Kumar, global chief technology officer, and chief development officer, Walmart Inc., in a statement shared ahead of the CES keynote. “It’s retail that is not only e-commerce or in-store, but a single, unified retail experience that seamlessly blends t",

    "extractedText": "Mastercard is launching a new generative AI shopping tool called “Shopping Muse” that is designed to help users get personalized product recommendations. The tool is powered by Dynamic Yield, a personalization company that was acquired by Mastercard in April 2022. Mastercard says the idea behind Shopping Muse is to “revolutionize how customers search for and discover products in a retailer’s digital catalogue.” The tool can take users’ colloquial language and turn it into tailored product recommendations. Shopping Muse is able to understand modern trends and phrases like “cottagecore” or “beach formal.” You can ask the tool questions like “What should I wear for a summer wedding?” or “Can you recommend pieces for a minimalist capsule wardrobe?” In order to provide personalized recommendations, Shopping Muse looks at the context of the user’s shopping experience, the direct question(s) it is being asked and the content of the conversation. The algorithms use data from the retailer’s product catalog, along with the shopper’s on-site behavior, such as clicking certain products and adding products to carts. The algorithms also look at real-time and known preferences the consumer demonstrates. If a user is logged-in, the algorithms may consider their past purchase and browsing history with that retailer, including any purchases made in-person that they connected to their account by providing the cashier their phone number or email, for example. Image Credits: Mastercard In addition to being able to help users search by phrase, Shopping Muse can also recommend items even when the user can’t find the words to describe what they’re looking for. Mastercard explains that “using integrated advanced image recognition tools, retailers can recommend relevant products based on visual similarities to others, even if they lack the right technical tags.” Although fashion is the first use case for Mastercard’s new tool, the company says this technology could extend into other categories, like furniture and grocery. “Personalization gives people the shopping experiences they want, and AI-driven innovation is the key to unlocking immersive and tailored online shopping,” said Ori Bauer, the CEO of Dynamic Yield by Mastercard, in a statement. “By harnessing the power of generative AI in Shopping Muse, we’re meeting the consumer’s standards and making shopping smarter and more seamless than ever.” Techcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

The new tool is one of many generative AI shopping tools released in the past year. For instance, Google now lets users receive AI-generated gift recommendations on Search, while Microsoft’s Bing can automatically generate buying guides when you use a query like “college supplies.” We’ll likely see more similar tools in the future, as Gartner recently released a report that predicts that 80% of customer service and support organizations will be applying generative AI technology in some form by 2025.

    "extractedText": "Google wants to inject a little generative AI into retail. Or to try, at least. To coincide with the National Retail Federation’s annual conference in NYC, Google Cloud today unveiled new GenAI products designed to help retailers personalize their online shopping experiences and streamline their back-office operations. As to whether they perform as advertised, this writer can’t say — TechCrunch wasn’t given the chance to test the new tools prior to this morning’s unveiling. (They’re set to launch sometime in Q1.) But the slew of announcements show, if nothing else, how aggressively Google is attempting to court GenAI customers. One of Google Cloud’s new products, Conversational Commerce Solution, lets retailers embed GenAI-powered agents on their websites and mobile apps — sort of like a brand-specific ChatGPT. The agents have conversations with shoppers in natural language, tailored product suggestions based on shoppers’ individual preferences. Branded chatbots are hardly new. But Google says that “sophisticated” models like PaLM are powering the agents, which can be fine-tuned and customized with retailers’ own data (e.g. catalogs and websites). Complementing Conversational Commerce Solution is Google Cloud’s new Catalog and Content Enrichment toolset, which taps GenAI models including the aforementioned PaLM and Imagen to automatically generate product descriptions, metadata, categorization suggestions and more from as little as a single product photo. The toolset also let retailers generate new product images from existing ones, or to use product descriptions as the basis for AI-generated photos of products. Now, when eBay launched a similar AI-powered product-image-to-description capability a few months back, it didn’t take long before sellers began complaining about its performance — pointing to misleading, unnecessarily repetitive and in some cases downright untruthful text.

San Francisco | October 13-15, 2026 WAITLIST NOW I asked Amy Eschliman, managing director of retail at Google Cloud, what steps Google’s taken, if any, to address concerns around such hallucinations. She didn’t point to specific measures but stressed that Google’s “continuously improving” its tools and that human review is a core part of the Catalog and Content Enrichment workflows. I’d certainly hope there’s human review where the stakes are high. It’s not inconceivable, after all, that a misleading AI-generated image or description in a product catalog could land a retailer in hot water with shoppers — or on the receiving end of false advertising allegations. “Human-in-the-loop is a best practice that helps with enterprise use cases to ensure high-quality, mitigate bias-related risk, improve trust and transparency, improve and continually train the model, while complying with regulatory and business policy,” Eschliman said. In a related announcement today, Google took the wraps off a retail-specific Distributed Cloud Edge device, a managed self-contained hardware kit to “reduce IT costs and resource investments” around retail GenAI. (Google’s long offered Distributed Cloud Edge as a service, but it’s now targeting retailers more directly.) Available in a range of sizes from single-server to multi-server configurations, Google says that the edge cluster is designed to fit into stores from convenience marts and gas stations to fast casual restaurants and grocery stores — powering customers’ GenAI apps. “With the … control plane running locally, Google Distributed Cloud Edge provides retailers non-stop operations even when their location is disconnected from the internet for short periods of time (days),” Eschliman said. “Retailers now have access to a small cluster of Google Cloud-managed nodes that can be conveniently installed in nearly any store. With this fully managed hardware and software, retailers can now run existing software with distributed AI to enable mission-critical operations in the store at all times.” Google says that pricing and availability info will be released in Q1.

    "extractedText": "Generative AI is good for more than marketing copy and anime-style avatars — or so Wayfair wants you to think. Today, Wayfair launched a new app with a cutesy name, Decorify, that lets customers create “shoppable,” “photorealistic” images of rooms in their homes or apartments in new styles. After uploading a picture of the space they want to redesign, the app enables them to transform the space with styles like “Modern Farmhouse,” “Bohemian” or “Industrial.” According to Shrenik Sadalgi, director of R&D at Wayfair, the infrastructure behind Decorify has been in the works for some time. But the advent of image-generating AI diffusion models such as OpenAI’s DALL-E 2 brought it over the finish line, improving the quality of the generated images to the point where Wayfair saw it fit to ship. “Our hypothesis is that the quality is good enough to drive value for a customer,” Sadalgi told TechCrunch in an email interview. “Wayfair’s customers are looking for, and love, visual inspiration — they get that from our rich lifestyle imagery that we custom produce and curate. Now they can blend that with their spaces.” Decorify, which doesn’t require downloading a dedicated app, is pretty easy to use. After launching Decorify on the web (on desktop or mobile) and logging in with a Google or GitHub account or an email address, the app prompts you to upload a photo of your space. For now, Decorify only supports living rooms, disappointingly — Wayfair says that’ll change in the future. Once you’ve uploaded a photo, Decorify prompts you to choose a style: “Traditional,” “Modern,” “Farmhouse,” “Bohemian,” “Rustic,” “Industrial,” “Glam” or “Perfectly Pink.” Then, the app “transforms” your room, replacing the fixtures, rugs and furniture in the photo with products in the selected style.

San Francisco | October 13-15, 2026 WAITLIST NOW The experience brings to mind REimagineHome, an app that similarly taps generative AI to restyle images of spaces. Interior AI is another along those same lines. What Wayfair brings to the table, then, isn’t novel technology necessarily, but the might of its brand and massive online inventory. Image Credits: Wayfair “Combining the visual discovery and inspiration with shoppable products from an extensive catalog that covers everything home, Decorify has the potential to drive significant value for Wayfair customers,” Sadalgi added. “Wayfair hopes Decorify can kick off a camera-first shopping paradigm for visual discovery where the journey simply starts with clicking an image.” In my brief testing, Decorify worked well enough — style depending. I had the best luck with “Rustic” and “Modern,” which, true to the app’s sales pitch, replaced my pictured couch, TV, entertainment console, table, chairs, siding and even ceiling with items you might find in Wayfair’s catalog. Image Credits: Wayfair Decorify isn’t perfect, though. The products in the transformed photos aren’t actually real — they’re only meant to serve as inspiration. Decorify provides a list of the best matches available on Wayfair, but the suggestions weren’t often that close in my experience. And, as I alluded to earlier, Decorify struggles to apply some of the styles. “Pink” gave my furniture a very uneven coat of bright pink, while “Glam” mistook a table for some kind of Victorian-era fainting couch. One of Decorify’s failure cases. Sadalgi stressed that this is an early version of the tech that’ll improve with time. Currently, Decorify is using Stable Diffusion, the open source diffusion model from Stability AI, as the base model. But Wayfair plans to gradually fine-tune the model on its in-house image data. “We’re confident that we can fine-tune the model using proprietary Wayfair brand data so the results look a lot closer to a lifestyle photo that you see on Wayfair today, with more creative control over the style and one-to-one correlation with real products,” Sadalgi said. “In the short term, Decorify will support more rooms and improve the shoppability … We plan to offer swapping out furniture with specific furniture you may have alread",

    "extractedText": "Amazon’s Prime Day, which leads to an overall boost to U.S. e-commerce thanks to competitive sales, saw a significant increase in retail traffic driven by generative AI products, including chatbots and browsers. According to a post-Prime Day analysis by Adobe Analytics, GenAI traffic to U.S. retail sites increased by 3,300% year-over-year — which was more than the firm had originally forecast. Adobe’s e-commerce division provided an analysis of the U.S. retail landscape encompassing over 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail websites, including 100 million SKUs across 18 product categories. During the Amazon Prime Day event (July 8-11), U.S. retailers saw $24.1 billion in online spend, representing 30.3% year-over-year growth, or the equivalent of two Black Fridays. (Black Friday 2024 saw $10.8 billion in online spend, which was then a new benchmark for the holiday shopping event.) The actual results from the firm’s Prime Day analysis came in slightly higher than its estimates, which predicted $23.8 billion would be spent with U.S. e-commerce retailers over the four-day period, representing 28.4% year-over-year growth. As a result, the figures for the use of GenAI driving online shopping were higher as well, indicating increased consumer interest in using generative AI-powered chat services and browsers as online shopping assistants. However, this AI-driven traffic still remains much smaller than other channels like email or paid search, Adobe noted. Paid search, for example, accounted for a 28.5% share of U.S. e-commerce sales during the Prime Day event, up 5.6% year-over-year. Another growing channel for driving retail clicks this year involved social media influencers, who drove 19.9% of U.S. online retail sales during the event. That figure was up 15% year-over-year, and data indicated that influencers converted shoppers into making purchases 10 times more effectively than social media overall. Amazon didn’t share specific Prime Day figures, only saying that it was the biggest event ever with record sales and more items sold than before. However, the company also expanded Prime Day to a four-day event this year, making comparisons to prior years difficult.

San Francisco | October 13-15, 2026 WAITLIST NOW According to one third-party analysis from Momentum Commerce, reported by Adweek, Prime Day sales during its first two days were initially down 35% year-over-year, then increased by day three to be up 165% year-over-year. This suggests that shoppers may have been waiting until the later sale days to see if their items would receive deeper discounts. Adobe noted that top categories driving U.S. e-commerce sales during the Prime Day event this year included appliances, where online sales were up 112%, compared to average daily sales in June. Other categories that saw strong growth included office supplies (up 105%), electronics (up 95%), books (up 81%), tools and home improvement (up 76%), home and garden (up 58%), and baby and toddler (up 55%).

    "extractedText": "Following Amazon’s adoption of generative AI for advertisers last week, Google today is launching a set of generative AI product imagery tools for advertisers in the U.S. Via the new, AI-powered Product Studio, merchants and advertisers will be able to leverage text-to-image AI capabilities to create new product imagery for free, simply by typing in a prompt of the image they want to use. The feature can be used for simple tasks, like changing the color of the background behind the product images or making the background a solid color. Or it could be used for something more advanced, like requesting a product be shown in a particular scene. For example, when the company first announced the feature in May, it suggested a skincare company could request seasonal imagery by typing something like a product that was “surrounded by peaches with tropical plants in the background.” Now that same company could request something winter-related, like the product “sitting on snow surrounded by pine branches or pinecones.” Image Credits: Google The generative AI model can also help to improve low-quality images without requiring a reshoot as well as remove a distracting background, Google said. By offering AI imagery capabilities, businesses of all sizes will have the ability to create professional images alongside their ads, without having to spend repeatedly on new photography sessions. We expect the feature will be used to augment the existing product photography a business already has on hand, allowing them to reuse their assets across different campaigns — like seasonal efforts or those centered around some sort of theme — even if it doesn’t replace the initial photoshoot. The feature is being made available to all Merchant Center Next users in the U.S. and the Google and YouTube app on Shopify, Google says. It begins rolling out today. The AI feature launched alongside other new additions for merchants, including a “small business” attribute for Google Search and Maps that will highlight to customers which brands have designed themselves as small businesses. Google said it will automatically add this attribute to some listings based on factors like how many products they offer or how much web traffic they see. However, businesses can also set the attribute or remove it from the Merchant Center or their Business Profile at any time. Image Credits: Google Google says it will also start showing more information to shoppers through the knowledge panel when customers are looking up merchant names on Search. Previously, this panel would share information like the location of the business’s HQ or the number of employees.

    "extractedText": "Meta announced today it’s rolling out its first generative AI features for advertisers, allowing them to use AI to create backgrounds, expand images and generate multiple versions of ad text based on their original copy. The launch of the new tools follows the company’s Meta Connect event last week where the social media giant debuted its Quest 3 mixed-reality headset and a host of other generative AI products, including stickers and editing tools, as well as AI-powered smart glasses. In the case of AI tools for the ad industry, the new products may not be as wild as the celebrity AIs that let you chat with virtual versions of people like MrBeast or Paris Hilton, but they showcase how Meta believes generative AI can assist the brands and businesses that are responsible for delivering the majority of Meta’s revenue. The first among the trio of new features allows an advertiser to customize their creative assets by generating multiple different backgrounds to change the look of their product images. This is similar to the technology that Meta used to create the consumer-facing tool Backdrop, which allows users to change the scene or the background of their image by using prompts. However, in the ad toolkit, the backgrounds are generated for the advertiser based on their original product images and will tend to be “simple backgrounds with colors and patterns,” Meta explains. The feature is available to those advertisers using the company’s Advantage+ catalog to create their sales ads. Another feature, image expansion, allows advertisers to adjust their assets to fit different aspect ratios required across various products, like Feed or Reels, for example. Also available to Advantage+ creative in Meta’s Mads Manager, the AI feature would allow advertisers to spend less time repurposing their creative assets, including images and video, for different surfaces, Meta claims. With the text variations feature in Meta Ads Manager, the AI can generate up to six different variations of text based on the advertiser’s original copy. These variations can highlight specific keywords and input phrases the advertiser wants to emphasize, and advertisers can edit the generated output or simply choose the best one or ones that fit their goals. During the campaign, Meta can also display different combinations of text to different people to see which ones drive better responses. However, Meta won’t showcase the performance details for each specific text variation, it says, as the reporting is currently based on a single ad. However, the more options the advertiser selects to run, the more opportunities they’ll have to improve their ad performance, Meta informs them. Meta says it’s already tested these AI features with a small but diverse set of advertisers earlier this year, and their early results indicate that generative AI will save them five or more hours per week, or a total of one month per year. However, the company admits that there’s still work ahead to better customize the generative AI output to match each advertiser’s style. In addition, Meta says there are more AI features to come, noting it’s working on new ways to generate ad copy to highlight selling points or generative backgrounds with tailored themes. Plus, as it announced at Meta Connect, businesses will be able to use AI for messaging on WhatsApp and Messenger to chat with customers for e-commerce, engagement and support.

    "extractedText": "Amid all the “is this a bubble?” talk about artificial intelligence, the supply chain and logistics industries have become breeding grounds for seemingly genuine uses of the technology. Flexport, Uber Freight, and dozens of startups are developing different applications and winning blue-chip customers. But while AI helps Fortune 500s pad their bottom line (and justify the next layoff to Wall Street), the right use of the tech is proving useful to smaller businesses. Netstock, an inventory management software company founded in 2009, is working on just that. It recently rolled out a generative AI-powered tool called the “Opportunity Engine” that slots into its existing customer dashboard. The tool pulls info from a customer’s Enterprise Resource Planning software and uses that information to make regular, real-time recommendations. Netstock claims the tool is saving those businesses thousands. On Thursday, the company announced it has served up 1 million recommendations to date, and that 75% of its customers have received an Opportunity Engine suggestion valued at $50,000 or more. While tantalizing, one of those customers — Bargreen Ellingson, a family-run 65-year-old restaurant supply company — was initially apprehensive about using an artificial intelligence product. “Old family companies don’t trust blind change a lot,” chief innovation officer Jacob Moody told TechCrunch. “I could not have gone into our warehouse and said, ‘Hey, this black box is going to start managing.’” Instead, Moody pitched Netstock’s AI internally as a tool that warehouse managers could “either choose to use, or not use” — a process he describes as “eagerly, but cautiously dipping our toes” into AI.

San Francisco | October 13-15, 2026 WAITLIST NOW Moody says it’s helping avoid mistakes, in part because it’s sifting through myriad reports his staff uses to make inventory decisions. He acknowledged the AI summaries of this info are not 100% accurate, but said it “helps create signals from the noise” quickly, especially during off-hours. Image Credits:Netstock The “more profound” change Moody noticed is the software made some of Bargreen Ellingson’s less-senior warehouse staff “more effective.” He highlighted an employee in one of Bargreen’s 25 warehouses who has worked there for two years. The employee has a high school diploma but no college degree. Training this employee to understand all of the inventory management tools and the forecasting information Bargreen uses to plan inventory levels will take time, he said. “But he knows our customers, he knows what he’s putting on the truck every day, so for him, he can look at the system and have this prosaic AI-driven insight and very quickly understand whether it makes sense or doesn’t make sense,” he said. “So he feels empowered.” Netstock co-founder Barry Kukkuk told TechCrunch that he understands the hesitancy around new technologies — especially because so many products are essentially mediocre chatbots attached to existing software. He attributes the early success of Netstock’s Opportunity Engine to a few things. The company has more than a decade’s worth of data from working with retailers, distributors, and light manufacturers. That data is tightly protected to adhere to ISO frameworks, but it’s what powers the models that make the recommendations. (He said Netstock is using a combination of AI tech from the open source community and private companies.) Each recommendation can be rated with a thumbs up or thumbs down, but the models also get reinforced by whether the customer takes the suggested action or not. While that kind of reinforcement learning can lead to weird, sometimes harmful results when applied to things like social media, Kukkuk said he’s chasing different incentives. “I don’t really care about eyeballs, you know?” he said. “Facebook and Instagram care about eyeballs, so they want you to look at their stuff. We care about: ‘what is the outcome for the customer?’” Kukkuk’s wary of expanding those interactions due to the limitations of current generative AI tech. While it mi",

    "extractedText": "Zyod, an Indian startup offering apparel sourcing and manufacturing services to fashion brands globally, has raised $3.5 million in a seed round led by Lightspeed Venture India Partners. As the e-commerce sector makes inroads, consumers are finding increasing convenience in purchasing clothes online. However, fashion brands continue to grapple with the challenges of sourcing and producing garments in order to meet the fast-growing demands of the industry. These brands contend with inventory risk as they strive to stay in sync with trends and consumer preferences, which can lead to inventory write-offs and threaten profitability. Enter Zyod, a technology startup aiming to tackle these issues. The Gurugram-based startup claims it can disrupt the apparel industry by delivering a new product range in a mere 21 days, with a minimum order quantity of just 50 pieces. This stands in stark contrast to the traditional supply chain’s 180-day lead time and 2,000-piece minimum order, said Zyod co-founder Ankit Jaipuria in an interview. He said the startup’s end-to-end service enables fashion brands to reduce their inventory, which is a crucial strategy for success in today’s market. Jaipuria started Zyod with co-founder Ritesh Khandelwal earlier this year, and since its inception, the startup has served a roster of over 150 clients across 13 countries. He refrained from disclosing specific brand names, but revealed the three major customer archetypes to which Zyod caters. One category consists of smaller direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands lacking alternatives in the current market landscape. The second would be international importers and wholesalers who have traditionally relied on Chinese suppliers are now seeking alternatives as businesses adopt the China-plus-one strategy to lessen their dependence on manufacturing in the country. Lastly, Jaipuria noted that large brands seeking to expand their product range and adopt a more demand-driven approach also make up a significant portion of Zyod’s clientele. Zyod is not alone in helping solve supply chain constraints for fashion brands in the market. However, other players are operating as aggregators of supply in the market: working on floating out queries they get from brands to all the suppliers they have in their networks, according to Jaipuria.

San Francisco | October 13-15, 2026 WAITLIST NOW “They are merely aggregating different suppliers and serving the brand, whereas where we are different is we are actually going deep into the manufacturing,” he said. Zyod is leveraging India’s unique cluster-based supply chain, which spans beyond metropolitan areas and tier-1 cities, to bring its solutions to a larger cohort. By training local apparel manufacturers with proprietary technology, the startup lets manufacturers create products that can appeal to international brands. Furthermore, Zyod employs AI to power a design recommendation engine for brands. This approach, Zyod says, lets it deliver a more personalized experience to its clientele while enhancing the efficiency of the design process. The AI system does market trend analysis, brand profiling and iterative feedback loops based on the order history of its customers to create different style recommendations. “For a new brand, it could be on the basis of the market analysis and basic profiling once the brand gets on board. But as you grow with us, we will have an iterative feedback loop. Let’s say I offered you 100 styles out of which you selected 20 styles. I will know the attributes of the 20 styles you selected. So, the next offering that I will give you would be based on the attributes of the selected 20 styles,” the co-founder explained. The seed funding round also saw participation from FJ Labs, Panthera Peak Capital and angels such as Tracxn co-founder Abhishek Goyal and Oyo global COO Abhinav Sinha. Zyod plans to deploy the fresh funds to refine its solutions. This includes enhancing the efficiency of its design recommendation engine and advancing its technology to create a fully-automated supply chain. The startup is a",

    "extractedText": "The advent of the internet combined with the ability to customize items such as clothing long ago created a revolution in marketing, especially for merchandise purposes. I think we’re all familiar with the “merch” phenomena by now, no? Benefiting from that long-term trend is SME-focused, customized merchandise startup Bizay, which has been able to raise a significant funding round, even in this relatively flat market of 2023. Following a Series C of $38.6 million (€32 million), which I reported on in 2020, the Lisbon, Portugal-based startup has now raised a Series “C2” (not yet a full series D) of €18 million ($19.78 million) in order to push into the U.S. market. The round was led by previous lead investor Indico Capital Partners, which was once again joined by fellow Portugal investors Iberis Capital and Lince Capital. That takes Bizay’s total funding to €72 million ($79 million), though, when asked what they think the company’s valuation is now, a spokesperson demurred. However, outside observers may well surmise a valuation of anywhere between $180-$220 million at this point. Suffice it to say, it’s not entirely surprising that customer merchandise continues to do well. Companies love to send out brand merch, and because of technological advances, the market just gets easier to serve. The global custom apparel market size (that’s clothing only) was valued at over $48 billion in 2022 and is expected to expand to $70 billion by 2028. Customized T-shirts alone are projected to be worth more than $3 billion in 2025. Bizay says its “special sauce” is a supply chain system for product customization which combines merchandising, packaging, apparel and a wide range of product customization, and has managed to ram down the costs and up the number of product categories it can serve — even down to customized company-barded watches, if that’s your thing. Over a call, Bizay co-founder Jose Salgado told me: “We see an increasing trend for customization across many different segments. It’s a way for them to self-express.” And Salgado says if, for instance, the Texas Broncos want 50,000 customized T-shirts, the company has “invested a lot of effort.” Techcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | October 13-15, 2026 WAITLIST NOW “We are able to be competitive for small quantities, but also for medium or large quantities. We’ve done an extensive work into R&D, understanding how to scale. This is about industrial production. There are huge setup costs. What we enable our suppliers to do within the same job is to be producing several orders at the same time. With that, there’s a huge, huge cost saving.” He points out that the company has “no factories, no machines, no stocks” but is instead enabling a fairly complex value chain to deliver products: “We can have the three production suppliers within the same value chain because for each of those steps, we choose the best supplier. So there’s a really big optimization of the supply chain,” he told me. It’s clear there’s an e-commerce opportunity not just for SMEs. What’s also partly going on out there is an explosion in the creative economy, where — for instance— influencers are hooking up their various social platforms to customized merchandise platforms in order to, frankly, make some damn money. Consider that earlier this year the #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt hashtag had over 71 billion views — it’s clear influencer marketing is alive and well. Indeed, fans of the Sheffield band Bring Me The Horizon can purchase personalized BMTH t-shirts by simply connecting their Spotify account or e-mail to the band’s merchandise website. Bizay is of course often competing with the numerous print-on-demand shops out there, from Printful to Printify, Gelato, Gooten and Art of Where. The question is, how does one distinguish between these myriad players. Salgado counters that these companies focus on a single technology and says many of them are vertically integrated, and thus dependent on the production they have in house: “We can go deeper on the options that we have on each of the products, and are independent on the quantity and on",

    "extractedText": "Gather AI, a startup using drones to inventory items in warehouses, today announced that it raised $10 million in a Series A round led by Tribeca Venture Partners with participation from Xplorer Capital, Dundee Venture Capital, Expa, Bling Capital, XRC Labs and 99 Tartans. The proceeds bring the company’s total raised to $17 million, which CEO Sankalp Arora says is being put toward expanding Gather’s deployment capacity and go-to-market plans as well as hiring new machine learning engineers. Arora co-founded Gather AI in 2019 with Daniel Maturana and Geetesh Dubey, graduate students at Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics Institute. The trio had the idea to use drones to gather data — specifically data in warehouses, such as the number of items on a shelf and the locations of particular pallets. Over the course of several years, they designed a prototype of an inventory monitoring system that used off-the-shelf autonomous drones, which became Gather’s core product. “The space we are operating in is about providing automation with zero capital expenditure and enabling our customers to work at the efficiency of Amazon without needing the hundreds of millions of dollars they pour into their warehouses,” Arora told TechCrunch in an email interview. “Off-the-shelf hardware is more reliable and proven than custom-engineered hardware and our software is drone-agnostic so we can source from a large supply chain with no factory to manage.” Gather isn’t the first to market with a drone-based inventory monitoring system. Boston-based Corvus Robotics, too, leverages indoor drones to help warehouses keep track of stock. So does Pensa Systems, Vimaan, Intelligent Flying Machines, Vtrus and Verity. But Arora makes the case that Gather’s approach is more fungible — and less costly — than that of its rivals because it relies on consumer as opposed to custom-built drones. While consumer-grade drones usually lack high-quality sensors, they’re more attainable and scalable than their commercial counterparts, according to Arora, and still able to perform tasks like detecting damaged inventory (with thermal scanning) and counting pallet cases. They’re also more replaceable — Gather swaps drones out for free in the event one malfunctions. “A core innovation of our company is that we can achieve sophisticated state estimation on commodity hardware, and we can fly autonomously without GPS on drones that you can walk into a Best Buy and buy tomorrow if you wanted,” Arora said. “Consumer drones use consumer hardware, and unlike the high-end sensors in expensive robots you’re stuck using monocular vision on rolling shutter cameras that have a ‘Jell-O’ effect, and asynchronous sensor data. This was a huge challenge to solve, but now that we have overcome it our autonomy is extensible to non-drone commodity applications in the future.” Gather’s drones scan the sides of boxes in warehouses, updating inventory as they fly. Image Credits: Gather AI Arora says Gather also benefits from “network effects” in the sense that each new pallet its drones scan increases the size of the data set the company uses to train its inventory-classifying systems. This in turn improves the overall accuracy of the platform’s image processing.

Gather’s other innovation lies in the platform’s autonomy software, which doesn’t require customers to make changes to their warehouse layouts or infrastructure. Gather’s drones work in dark warehouses with motion sensor lights — the drones are equipped with night vision — and run on an iPad attached to the drone controller that works absent Wi-Fi. Setup usually takes a matter of weeks and costs clients “little to nothing,” Arora says. Arora claims that Gather drones are now deployed in 14 warehouses and scanning “thousands” of pallets every week for customers in industries such as air cargo, third-part",

    "extractedText": "Fashion startup Virgio, co-founded by Amar Nagaram, former chief executive of Myntra, has raised $37 million in a new financing round as the young firm looks to build “a global fashion brand” from the South Asian market. Prosus Ventures, Alpha Wave and Accel co-led Virgio’s Series A funding, valuing the one-year-old startup at $161 million (post-money). (Virgio says it was founded this year, but hasn’t disclosed its seed funding round.) Virgio says consumers’ fashion preferences are changing rapidly and they are not satisfied with the incumbents’ offerings. It is attempting to solve this by streamlining design, manufacturing and purchasing processes in “real-time,” offering Gen Z and late millennials a platform where they can discover and purchase the new trendy apparels. Virgio offers a wide range of selection in casual, party and ethnic wear. Each week it adds new selections and customers receive large discounts and free shipping. The startup’s approach has prompted some to draw comparisons between its model with that of the behemoth Shein. “Traditionally, the fashion industry has operated on depth and discount models,” said Nagaram, founder and chief executive of Virgio, in a statement. “At the core of Virgio is the tech foundation, which is always listening to evolving trends on social media platforms and predicting the demand for each trend. This is then fed into our agile and responsive supply chain to enable the trendiest, elegant and yet affordable line in near real-time. Thus, Virgio is pioneering the test and scale method, making runway fashion accessible and affordable for all consumers, while eliminating excess inventory for manufacturers,” said Nagaram, a Flipkart veteran who took over Myntra’s top job in 2019 before leaving the firm last year.

Its eponymous app has already amassed more than 100,000 downloads, it said. (On Sensor Tower, the app reflects very little metrics as it is still too small.) “There is a large underserved market for branded apparel in India currently. For example, for women, only ~25% of fashion is branded apparel. The fashion industry in India is thus at an inflection point, driven by changing consumer preferences as a result of social media’s influence, an important Gen-Z characteristic to individualize as a form of expression, and the integration of social commerce with social media platforms,” said Ashutosh Sharma, head of India Investments at Prosus Ventures, in a statement. “We are confident in Virgio’s tech-first model and believe the startup’s expert founding team is uniquely positioned to capture a large opportunity in India’s fashion industry,” he added.

Subscribe: Apple Podcasts Spotify RSS All episodes All episodes Details Transcript May 25, 2023 Strategy is about making the future happen, not just reacting to it, according to author Gary Hamel. And with generative artificial intelligence, senior leaders suddenly wield an awesome new tool to change the fortunes of their organizations. The promise of generative AI is more than just a sweet hack to boost productivity and streamline operations. Its deeper potential lies in companies that rethink what they do and conjure brand-new, AI-first products and services. Simply put, generative AI is blasting open new strategic paths to create novel business opportunities, even as it brings serious risks and heightened competition. In this episode, How Generative AI Changes Strategy, HBR editor in chief Adi Ignatius speaks to Microsoft’s head of strategy Chris Young and Harvard Business School professor Andy Wu. They lay out the technology, its emerging value chains, and its main providers. They also break down the key choices and tradeoffs that large and small companies alike will be making in this fast-changing market. This is the fourth and final episode in the special series How Generative AI Changes Everything. Each week, HBR editor in chief Adi Ignatius and HBR editor Amy Bernstein have been hosting conversations with experts and business leaders about the impact of generative AI. Find those episodes on the impact on productivity, creativity, and organizational culture in the HBR IdeaCast feed. And for more on ethics in the age of AI, check out HBR’s Big Idea on implementing the new technology responsibly. HBR EDITOR IN CHIEF ADI IGNATIUS: Chris, you’ve been a tech company CEO. You’re strategy head at Microsoft. You’ve seen a lot of technologies over the years. There’s some that land and we think, “Okay, this is truly transformative, disruptive. This is an inflection point.” In your mind, is that where we are now? Or do we need to wait and see what the impact of generative AI will be on business and on everything? MICROSOFT EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT CHRIS YOUNG: We’re at a place where we see this as truly transformative. I might actually draw a contrast to one of the trends that many people were very excited about in the tech landscape just a little bit over a year ago, which was Web3 and the promise of blockchains, and everything that would happen. But there was definitely a segment of the world that was saying, “Well, interesting, but not sure what the practical applications are here, not sure it’s going to change everything.” No one’s saying that about AI. I think immediately, many of us recognize that this is going to be completely game changing, not only for the tech landscape, but for humanity. ADI IGNATIUS: Welcome to How Generative AI Changes Everything, a special series of the HBR IdeaCast. There are many shorthand definitions of strategy. One that I like is from the author, Gary Hamel, who says that strategy is about making the future happen, not just reacting to it. Well, this sure feels like a time when it’s possible to make the future happen. Generative AI has stormed to the consciousness of practically every business leader, and it’s opening up new strategic paths and new ways to create new businesses. This week, How Generative AI Changes Strategy. I’m Adi Ignatius, editor in chief of Harvard Business Review and your host for this episode.

Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for August 20, 2021. The week is finished, but our work to catch up with the torrent of technology, startup and venture capital news is not. Today we have software companies investing in hotels, profitable scooters, at-home rowing machines and TikTok radio? Oh, and apparently Elon is building a robot. It’s a great group of stories! — Alex The TechCrunch Top 3 Microsoft backs OYO: A while back TechCrunch broke the news that Microsoft might back Indian hotel upstart OYO. It was a bit of a wild story, as it didn’t seem to make that much sense. Well, the deal happened. Microsoft has invested $5 million into the company at a $9.6 billion valuation. Notably, that is only a slight discount from the company’s old $10 billion valuation. Next up for OYO is an IPO, we presume. Bird shows improving scooternomics: American scooter company Bird is going public via a SPAC — more here — and we got a look at the company’s most recent financial performance. In short, a shake-up of its operating model has improved its economics, even if the company still has a long way to go to turning a real profit. China shakes up its data privacy rules: For companies, that is, not the state; don’t expect the CCP to start respecting privacy anytime soon. But for companies in the country, a strict new law called the Personal Information Protection Law is coming into effect November 1. Per TechCrunch, the new set of rules will require “app makers to offer users options over how their information is or isn’t used, such as the ability not to be targeted for marketing purposes or to have marketing based on personal characteristics.” Startups/VC Alerzo raises $10.5M to digitize Nigeria’s economy: Nigeria’s expanding startup scene got another boost today with Alerzo’s latest round. The “B2B e-commerce retail” startup wants to help bring the country’s informal economy online. According to TechCrunch that part of the Nigerian economy is worth some $100 billion. São Paulo-based QuintoAndar puts points on the board for Brazil: What does one do after raising a $300 million round? Well, if you are a Brazilian property technology company, you raise another $120 million. That’s what QuintoAndar just did, at an eye-popping $5.1 billion valuation. The company connects demand and supply in the country’s rental and home markets. For more on Africa’s startup market, head here. And if you want more notes on Brazil, we’ve got you covered. Breef wants to connect brands and agencies: Normally we’d try to make a pun about how we hope that this startup’s life is not, ahem, breef, but we’re more mature than that. Instead, we’ll note that the Greycroft-backed company just raised $3.5 million, and it connects teams at boutique agencies with larger, more long-term contracts with brands than what most freelance platforms offer. Cardiomatics does just what it says on the tin: Yes, Cardiomatics is an electrocardiogram-reading automation company, like you surmised from its name. And it just loaded its accounts with $3.2 million. The company helps “GPs and smaller practices offer ECG analysis to patients without needing to refer them to specialist hospitals,” TechCrunch reports. Rutter is building the Plaid of e-commerce data: API-delivered startups are hot these days. Connecting various services in a particular niche via API is a popular idea as well. And e-commerce is booming. At the intersection of those three trends is Rutter, which just raised $1.5 million and is building a “unified e-commerce API that enables companies to connect with data across any platform.” Very cool.

Startups that don’t offer employees work-from-home flexibility are at a competitive disadvantage, but figuring out how to pay hybrid workers raises a complex set of questions: Should you localize salaries for workers in different areas? How should you pay workers who have the same job when one is WFH and the other is at their desk?

These organizations raked in profits and growth during the pandemic when offices shuttered and employees moved en masse to work from home. But as the economy turned last year and more workers returned to the office, their numbers slipped. At the same time, enterprise SaaS companies are dealing with several other major problems that have come together to knock them off their perches. Over the last year, TechCrunch has worked to better understand the current climate for selling software. It’s the most common startup product, and SaaS is the most common business model. So we pay special attention to leading SaaS companies on the public markets, hunting for trends, data and other pieces of information that we can apply to the private markets. A changing economy, shifting investor expectations and other bumps have made the picture of the present-day software market hard to clarify. However, new data is sharpening our perspective. We parsed earnings reports this week from Zoom, Salesforce, Box, Snowflake and Okta. The results were mixed, with some doing better than others. How do enterprise SaaS companies fight the short-term economic turbulence and get to the other side (whenever that may be)? And what do one quarter’s numbers actually mean in the scheme of things? Let’s dig into the data. Economic headwinds blowing hard It’s not your imagination: Companies of all stripes have been facing a challenging backdrop in which to operate.

First came inflationary pressures, then came higher interest rates to combat inflation. Suddenly, money wasn’t cheap anymore. For startups, that meant tighter capital and more stunted valuations after years of gaudy (and perhaps unrealistic) numbers. For other companies, as interest rates have risen, it has had a negative impact on borrowing and spending. This was true for everyone, not just enterprise SaaS companies, but they were adversely affected nonetheless. But perhaps the biggest factor influencing the enterprise SaaS downturn has been a massive shift in investor expectations from growth to profitability. Companies with high marketing budgets, like Salesforce, have been under pressure to cut costs. We have seen this manifest itself in a number of ways, the most notable being layoffs. Companies that hired in huge numbers during the pandemic to meet growing demand were suddenly letting people go. Salesforce, the biggest of the enterprise SaaS companies, laid off 10% of its workforce as part of its attempts to cut costs, but it certainly wasn’t alone. As though all of that weren’t enough, there was the war in Ukraine, with Russia subsequently cutting off energy exports to Europe, all combining to put pressure on spending in the EU and generating a cascading impact across businesses. Finally, a strong U.S. dollar has been trouble for companies selling outside of U.S. markets as it has bitten into foreign profits and dragged down revenue growth overall. Ray Wang, founder and principal analyst at Constellation Research, said investors are now not looking at the same metrics in the same way, and the interest rates, in his view, are having the biggest impact. “What’s interesting is that we are no longer focused on fundamentals like we used to, such as market share, earnings growth and profitability. The public markets are only focused on Fed rates,” Wang told TechCrunch. “Taking that aside, what we do see is that the SaaS vendors are doing a good job in retention, double-digit growth and managing expenses. But the macro story is still about interest rates.” The bad news Despite being a recent winner in the enterprise software space, Box did not have a good run this earnings cycle. It barely cracked street expectations for revenue growth and guided under street expectations for its current quarter (by up to $12 million) and current fiscal year (by $40 million to $50 million).

    "extractedText": "With consumer focus being pulled in lots of directions these days, it’s that much harder for brands to capture attention for longer than the average scroll on social media. At the same time, purchases made via social platforms are poised to reach nearly $3 trillion, globally, by 2026. Nectar AI wants to provide direct-to-consumer and e-commerce brands with an easier way to connect with consumers. The social commerce platform was started by sisters Misbah Uraizee and Farah Uraizee, who saw this problem firsthand while both worked at Meta. Misbah was building AI-based conversational and monetization tools for businesses and consumers, while Farah was building out products on the Facebook Community and Groups side. “We were building these products to encourage people to spend more time within Meta’s ecosystem, and what we realized quickly was that the products were Band-Aids at best,” Misbah Uraizee told TechCrunch. “There’s a super-strong trend that we were seeing, especially from Gen Z, of a gravitational pull toward private messaging. Messaging has exploded in the last five years.” As evidence of this trend, Uraizee pointed to a recent interview of Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram, who said that much of the growth and time spent on Meta’s apps were within the Stories and direct messaging features. That’s why the Nectar AI team says brands need to find new ways to personally engage and convert consumers where they spend the most time. The company enables D2C and e-commerce companies to swap out the half-dozen tools they use now for Nectar’s AI-generated messaging tool that uses large language models and retrieval-augmented generation, to connect at scale, Farah Uraizee said in an interview. The company joins other companies catering to e-commerce, for example, SuperOrdinary, Loup (formerly Social Chat) and Rebuy. Where the Uraizees say Nectar AI stands out is in its personalization tech, including identity mapping from social to commerce profiles of customers, and that proprietary commerce focused LLM that brands can deploy wherever they interact with customers.

The founders still consider Nectar AI pretty stealthy — its product is in beta and they are not likely to offer it to the public until “sometime mid next year,” according to Misbah Uraizee. To fuel that launch, the company recently closed on $2 million in pre-seed funding in a round. It was led by Flying Fish Ventures’ Heather Gorham and included BAM Ventures, Trust Fund’s Sophia Amoruso, XRC Ventures, Fab Ventures, Yale Index Ventures, CMDN, Dash VC and a group of angel investors, including Jennifer Dulski. Nectar AI will initially target mid-sized fashion and beauty brands that manage thousands of comments across their social media channels. The new capital will help expand its engineering and AI teams. “Our sweet spot is brands that have a decent amount of engagement across their social platforms and that are investing heavily across these platforms for their organic and paid campaigns,” Misbah Uraizee said. “They have a huge burning problem around this, and now we’re trying to balance how brands across the funnel receive Nectar.” Embracing digital commerce may be retailers’ best bet for staying ahead of a fast-moving industry Topics Commerce, e-commerce, Farah Uraizee, Misbah Uraizee, Nectar AI, social commerce, Startups, Venture Christine Hall Senior Reporter Christine Hall wrote about enterprise/B2B, e-commerce, and foodtech for TechCrunch, and venture capital rounds for Crunchbase News.

    "extractedText": "It’s never been easier for non-programmers to launch and manage eCommerce sites. For most, the basic feature-set is well and plenty. But for those who want to push the envelope slightly with more sophisticated features like product recommendation, the daunting challenge of acquiring custom development is a deal-breaking deterrent. Barilliance wants to change that with a suite of eCommerce personalization features which are as simple as things can get in terms of integration: Copy/Paste a snippet of JavaScript. Barilliance offers four products that are designed to help sites increase sales and conversion rates through a personalized shopping experience for visitors: Product recommendations – Similar in concept and styling to Amazon’s personalized product recommendations. These display cross-sells and up-sells. Email personalization – Personalized product offers designed for integration within email marketing. Recommendations are based on the visitor’s activity on the e-commerce site. Onsite behavioral targeting – Site owners can determine website content based on pre-defined visitor segments like traffic source, search terms, time of day, and loyalty. Cart abandonment – Automated email campaigns for visitors who started but abandoned the checkout process. The personalization can be enhanced for sites that implemented Facebook Connect. In such sites, Barilliance can target visitors based on profile data, for example, showing a customized ad for visitors that have a birthday soon. There’s also the ability to show a “Friends also liked…” indicator that trumps the generalized “People also liked…” indicator. Obviously, these features require configuration and ongoing management, but the integration part—the copying and pasting of JS code—couldn’t be easier. If the integration is that easy, how then does Barilliance integrate with the site’s product catalog? Well, they scrape. That’s right, they put scraping to good use and build a product catalog without requiring the site owner’s intervention.

It will suggest different outfits on a user’s personalized avatar. The company is partnering with Google to use the company’s Gemini models and Vertex AI to deploy the experience. Separately, the company also got fresh backing from Google — which was already an investor — according to people familiar with the matter. Glance and Google didn’t comment on the funding details. Glance said that it is already experimenting with the new-gen AI-powered experience in the U.S. through a new app called Glance AI. The startup plans to roll out this experience to all users in the U.S. and India in the coming months. Google is trying to have more companies use its Gemini and Cloud platforms for AI implementation in India. The company is also investing in startups in parallel. Most recently, it backed the webtoon platform Toonsutra. Glance’s CEO, Naveen Tewari, said that the app’s model understands fashion trends and personalizes suggestions for you. “Think of this experience as looking through a fashion magazine with the latest apparel, where you are the model on each page,” Tewari said. Tewari added that the company wants to build a discovery engine and a feed so you can explore different items — and buy the ones you like the most.

San Francisco | October 13-15, 2026 WAITLIST NOW Users who download the app will have to upload a selfie of themselves, select their gender, hair length, and ethnicity, and specify their body type during the onboarding process. Subsequently, the app will generate a model for you using AI. Glance will then show you different looks on your lock screen. You can tap on a button on the lock screen to see some suggestions from the web that match the AI-generated avatar’s apparel. Glance fetches these results from the e-commerce sites it has partnered with. At launch, the company said it has 400 partners. The startup takes a cut if the customer completes a purchase thanks to affiliate links. In the Glance AI app, users can scroll through multiple outfit suggestions and even put them on the lock screen. On the app, apart from apparel, you would also get suggestions about other items present in the scene, such as a guitar or a candle. But at the moment, you can’t purchase them. In the future, users will be able to tune their suggestions using an upvote/downvote-like mechanism along with using chat to find inspiration for a specific look. Glance, which has over 300 million active users in markets like India, Japan, and Indonesia, primarily displays its content on Android-powered phones’ lock screens. While India is the largest user base for the company, it piloted its lock screen solution in the U.S. last year in partnership with Motorola. The company has started making inroads into showing this content on smart TVs as well. Companies and startups are trying to solve personalization in the e-commerce world through AI-powered search and agents, starting with tech giants like Google and Amazon.

    "extractedText": "The number of Shopify live websites grew a whopping 201% between March 2020 and January 2022 with the shift to e-commerce during the global pandemic. With all of those stores going after customers it’s difficult for individual merchants to cut through the clutter. That problem has given rise to startups eager to offer their no-code or low-code technology to help Shopify merchants build their businesses. For example, we saw Replo for landing pages, Triple Whale for shopper data, Postscript for personalized texting, Shop Circle to find the best apps to get a Shopify business going and Popup for online storefronts. In addition, all of those companies raised venture capital the past year for those respective tools. Minneapolis-based Rebuy is the latest commerce tech startup to attract new funding, in its case a $17 million Series A, to advance its premier personalization platform for online retailers. The round was led by M13, with Dynamism Capital, R-Squared Ventures and existing investors Peterson Ventures and Sidekick Partners joining in. Ben Jabbawy of Privy and Nik Sharma also came on as strategic investors. This follows a $4.4 million seed round in 2021, led by Peterson Ventures. Rebuy, founded in 2017 by brothers John Erck and James Van Erck, has an end-to-end SaaS offering for e-commerce — Shopify merchants in particular — that combines artificial intelligence with no-code or low-code technology. Merchants can then create personalized shopping experiences for their customers through upsells, cross-sells and post-purchase follow-ups. For example, to help notify customers that they get free shipping when they spend $100 or more, how to provide gifts with purchase or understand that to convert a user requires helping them discover the right product.

San Francisco | October 13-15, 2026 WAITLIST NOW It also provides data and AI intelligence to recommend ways to increase the average order value, improve the shopping cart and checkout processes, or help customers take a page from Amazon by recommending complementary products. James Van Erck told TechCrunch that there’s been a shift in how direct-to-consumer brands conduct themselves and how to expand their businesses. “With the iOS changes, it’s been harder and harder to track customers,” he said. “A year or two ago, brands were very focused on acquiring new customers. Now there’s been this shift around focusing more on your existing customers and helping to give them a much better experience. That’s what Rebuy is out to do: help create these intelligent shopping experiences.” That shift to existing customers validated what Rebuy had been working on over the past six years: generating smart product recommendations, John Erck said. He added that the company’s technology is currently running on close to 7,000 online stores, including 10% of all Shopify Plus merchants. In the past 12 months, the company tripled its revenue, released 218 new products or feature enhancements and launched integrations with e-commerce solutions, including Klaviyo and Attentive. Erck also said Rebuy was “well into the eight-figure annual recurring revenue stage.” In addition, the company more than doubled its customer count over the last year and currently serves more than 4 billion web requests per month, over 1 billion of which are behavioral analytics streaming into its AI engine. The company intends to deploy the new funds into technology development, investing in the Shopify ecosystem and additional hiring to complement its 70-employee workforce. One of the new hires is Jason Nelson, senior vice president of revenue. It is also interested in pursuing a multi-platform future so that any brand can use Rebuy independent of what platform they choose to run on. Additional investment will also go into new products, including Rebuy Search, Rebuy Intelligence Graph and Visual Editor.

With so much competing for consumers’ attention these days, rare is the brand that’s able to make a lasting first impression. According to Microsoft Research, people only spend about 10 seconds on a company’s homepage if the page doesn’t immediately connect with a marketing message. Debjani Deb, Manish Malhotra and Arnab Mukherjee, the co-founders of in-session marketing platform ZineOne, dealt with the hurdles around customer tracking firsthand at their previous jobs. Deb previously co-founded EmPower, a firm that provided tools for social media research and media monitoring, while Malhotra started his own company, Social Lair, to build social media capabilities for large enterprises. As for Mukherjee, he left Oracle to launch Udichi, a compute platform for “big data” analysis. In the early days of ZineOne, Deb, Malhotra and Mukherjee met at the Milpitas Library in Santa Clara and local coffee shops to speculate about where online marketing technology was heading. They came to the conclusion that recording real-time customer decisions was the key to boosting conversions, springboarding ZineOne’s first series of products. After attracting customers like Men’s Wearhouse, Wynn Resorts, Advance Auto Parts and Kohl’s, ZineOne has raised $28 million in Series C funding, the company today announced. SignalFire led the round, with participation from Norwest and others, bringing ZineOne’s total raised to $42 million. “We believe in-session marketing is a critical, and perhaps the most important, component of modern marketing for brands in a privacy-first world,” Deb told TechCrunch in an email interview. “What in-session marketing accomplishes, ultimately, is enabling brands to capture the optimal amount of conversion on their website which results in more efficient pre-purchase dollars and less reliance on re-marketing strategies.” Image Credits: ZineOne At a high level, ZineOne — which serves specifically e-commerce brands — uses AI to score behavior and personalize website and app users’ individual experiences. By observing a visitor’s first few clicks or taps, the platform can ostensibly customize the messaging, discount offers and product recommendations that they see in real time. It’s worth noting that, at least according to some surveys, a large segment of consumers don’t agree with any form of behavior tracking for marketing. Part of the rejection might stem from concerns over bias in AI systems, which have the potential to impact the experiences of certain customer segments. But Deb argues that ZineOne has protections in place to allay these fears.

San Francisco | October 13-15, 2026 WAITLIST NOW For example, ZineOne uses anonymized session data to conduct its analyses, Deb says — primarily a “granular set of behavioral events” for each visitor, including product detail views, cart updates and checkouts. Since the platform’s targeting derives from short-term behaviors, it doesn’t need to store any longitudinal identity or profile data, she claims. “ZineOne’s in-session marketing platform focuses on these three key pillars: understanding in-session behaviors for anonymous visitors (not just known customers), predicting outcomes and taking the optimal set of in-session actions,” Deb said. “ZineOne’s early purchase prediction model tells [brands] within 5 clicks which anonymous visitors are highly likely to make a purchase, who is on the fence and who is unlikely to buy in that session. They are then able to trigger experiences according to the consumers’ purchase propensity today, right now, in the moment.” ZineOne isn’t the only platform applying data analytics to drive e-commerce personalization.

Big retailers and smaller businesses are using AI to improve search, supply chains, and checkout. If AI companies (and their investors) have their way, shopping will soon be focused on chatting with an assistant, with businesses automating everything behind the scenes. Dubai-based Qeen.ai (stylized as qeen.ai) is working to make this a reality in the Middle East and beyond. The startup has raised $10 million to scale its platform, which provides autonomous AI agents for e-commerce businesses. Prosus Ventures, a major e-commerce investor, led the seed round, which is one of the largest not only in the Middle East’s AI industry but also in MENA overall. The VC believes Qeen.ai is well positioned to bring AI-driven automation to merchants as AI agents reshape online marketplaces. Founders Morteza Ibrahimi (CEO), Ahmad Khwileh (CTO), and Dina Alsamhan (CBO) started Qeen after years of working on AI at Google and DeepMind. Ibrahimi, in an interview with TechCrunch, said that they honed in on e-commerce in part opportunistically: All three had worked at Google Ads in various roles during their time with the search giant, and they saw firsthand how other alums built highly successful e-commerce businesses. On top of their AI expertise, the trio knew how to run ads and optimize SEO exceptionally well and thought it could be a strong combination.

That insight led them to build a platform that helps e-commerce sellers grow without relying on ads as their primary driver. The global e-commerce market is expanding fast, driven by changing consumer behavior, digital payments, and better logistics. In MENA, the market is expected to hit $50 billion by 2025, with Saudi Arabia and the UAE leading the growth. Qeen.ai is tapping into this boom by developing AI-powered marketing agents designed for e-commerce businesses across MENA. These fully automated agents handle content creation, marketing, and conversational sales, allowing small and midsized merchants to compete without relying on expensive agencies or deep ad expertise. Unlike traditional solutions, Qeen’s AI continuously learns from consumer interactions using its proprietary RL-UI technology, refining marketing strategies in real time for better results. From Google ads to AI-driven e-commerce While AI-powered sales and customer service tools often struggle with high churn rates, as businesses frequently switch platforms, Qeen.ai claims to see stronger retention in e-commerce and marketing. Ibrahimi attributes this to how deeply Qeen.ai’s AI agents integrate into merchants’ workflows, making them a core part of daily operations rather than a replaceable tool. A key feature driving engagement is dynamic text personalization, which adjusts content based on user behavior and device type. For example, an iPhone user might see product details in bullet points for quick reading, while a laptop user gets a detailed paragraph. Since launching its Dynamic Content agent in Q2 2024, Qeen.ai has served over 15 million users, generated 1 million SKU descriptions, and helped merchants increase sales by 30%, according to the company. “We worked with a client to optimize their content and SEO. After using our AI plugins, their search volume increased by 40%, and their Google ranking improved from 22 to 18 — all with zero manual effort. The e",

    "extractedText": "Editor’s Note: This guest post is written by Nir Eyal (@nireyal), a founder of two startups and an advisor to several Bay Area incubators. Nir blogs about technology and behavior design at nirandfar.com. Reading Leena Rao’s recent article on Techcrunch about the personalization revolution, you get the sense that the tech world is waiting for a bus that isn’t coming. Rao quotes well-known industry experts and luminaries describing what needs to happen for e-commerce to finally realize the promise of personalized shopping, a future where online retailers predict what you’ll want to buy before you know yourself. Ironically, Rao and her pundits are missing the zooming racecar that’s speeding by them as they wait for the personalization bus to arrive. That racecar is Pinterest and the new breed of startups marking the beginning of what I call the “Curated Web.” The promise of personalized e-commerce began over 10 years ago with technology pioneered at Amazon. It was then that the mental dye was cast for what eCommerce personalization would look like, an algorithmic solution for matching customer to products. Web watchers came to expect that someday all online retailers would have such algorithms on their sites and the dream of personalized commerce would finally be realized. For over a decade, startups took their best shot at making this apparition a reality. Companies like Hunch tackled the data collection piece of the equation, asking users endless survey questions to determine their tastes and preferences. Google’s Boutiques.com tried to crack the challenges of structuring the data associated with personalized shopping recommendations. Ultimately, these attempts failed. In September, Google shut down Boutiques.com and the founders of Hunch sold their company to eBay, an outcome far short of their IPO hopes. Previous attempts at eCommerce personalization were unsuccessful because those involved failed to realize they were missing one key element, the interface. Curated Web companies are defined by their ability to use new interfaces to collect and structure data better then previous algorithmic solutions. Users Want it All While the tech world waits patiently, expecting the solution to e-commerce personalization to look like Amazon ported to other online retailers, “Curated Web” companies like Pinterest are changing the game by changing the interface. Pinterest will be the first company to nail eCommerce personalization because they understand the importance of having an interface, which matches what the user is there to do, discover stuff they like from across the web. Pinterest has cracked personalization right under everyone’s nose by doing the two things Rao says have yet-to-be invented, data collection and data structuring.

Pinterest is becoming the web’s personalized mail-order catalog. Each user is presented with a one-of-a-kind visual interface based on their tastes. They are presented with any product, from any retailer, anywhere in the world. The items they see are curated through people and topics they’ve identified as interesting and what is shown to them improves the more they interact with it. Every time they pin, re-pin, like, or comment on an object, the relevancy of the products displayed on their magic catalog improves. This is what personalization looks like, effortless, simple, social and fun. It’s the interface, stupid. “Big deal?” you say. “Facebook can do this!” No, they can’t. Social media is for selectively sharing information about you and Facebook is built for presenting yourself in the way you want to be seen by others. Facebook is, by design, about creating a network of relationships and sharing with them selectively. This brings up all kinds of privacy concerns, which reduce the flow of content creation and sharing to limited circles (Yes, I said “circles.” Don’t even try it, Google). Pinterest has no such restrictions. Pins are inherently open and there is no expectation that anything shared is private. I",

It continues to be a challenge to capture those consumer dollars amid myriad messages coming at consumers from all directions. However, one startup thinks it has cracked the code on how brands and retailers can most effectively target and connect with customers. Meet Birdseye, a Toronto-based company focused on retail and e-commerce artificial intelligence. Matt Bogoroch started the company in 2021 with his brother, Adam Bogoroch, and Shardul Frey to provide e-commerce analytics for Shopify brands to improve their marketing and advertising efforts and put them in an even playing field with larger companies. They recognized that smaller, online retailers don’t have the dedicated analytics teams to provide the data needed to boost their marketing, thus leaving sales on the table. Two years later, the company has grown into a platform for large brands and retailers offering the skills of an AI-powered chief marketing officer, including executing hyper-personalization email and SMS campaigns and insights from retail transaction data, from one dashboard. Its technology computes millions of marketing actions for the retailer so they can match their customers with the products they most likely would be interested in purchasing at any given time and price.

In addition, Birdseye is able to alert retailers about potential customer churn so they can proactively respond with personalized offers to help retain them.

San Francisco | October 13-15, 2026 WAITLIST NOW “Each message and discount is unique, crafted by an advanced large language model, ensuring relevance and appeal to each recipient,” CEO Matt Bogoroch told TechCrunch via email. “Imagine Nike having 800 units of size 16 yellow shoes that are struggling to sell due to their unique size/color combination. Birdseye’s AI can identify customers who prefer yellow and wear size 16, then reach out with personalized pricing for the shoes — all without human intervention.” The company is working with approximately 120 logos, including Midori, bag & bougie and Eva Franco. That is an increase of 100% since the beginning of the year, Bogoroch said. He declined to go into specifics about revenue growth. Birdseye secured $500,000 in a pre-seed round from Drive Capital in March. Today, the venture capital firm infused additional capital into the company, this time $3 million in seed funding. As part of the investment, Drive Capital partner Masha Khusid will join Birdseye’s board of directors. With the funding, Birdseye has two years of runway and will focus on growing its customer base to include more mid-market and enterprise companies. It will also grow from eight to 14 engineers, mainly on the machine learning side, Bogoroch said.

    "extractedText": "Jarvis ML, a platform offering an AI-powered personalization engine to brands selling products, services and experiences, today announced that it raised $16 million in a seed round led by Dell Technologies Capital. In an interview with TechCrunch, CEO Rakesh Yadav said that the new capital will be used to grow Jarvis ML’s R&D and sales and marketing teams to “accelerate product development and market penetration.” As the pandemic spurred brands to spruce up — or create from scratch — online presences, the value of personalization came into acute focus. Accustomed to Netflix- and Amazon-like tailored product recommendations, customers began to demand the same from companies of all sizes. According to McKinsey, 71% of shoppers now expect businesses to deliver personalized interactions, while 76% get frustrated when this doesn’t happen. Some research — particularly from customer analytics vendors, unsurprisingly — suggests that personalization is a worthwhile investment. Forty percent of consumers responding to one survey said they’ve purchased something more expensive than originally planned because of personalized experiences. But creating this type of personalization can be challenging from a technical standpoint. That’s why Yadav founded Jarvis ML in 2021. A former senior staff engineer at Google, where he led the development of the machine learning platforms behind Google Payments and Google Ads, Yadav sought to create a product that could enable companies to turn data into brand engagements, like marketing campaigns or customized web experiences. “The pandemic has accelerated the shift in consumer purchasing trends moving online. That also means that online recommendation strategies are mission critical for enterprises to adapt to this changing consumer paradigm,” Yadav told TechCrunch via email. “Giant tech companies like Amazon, Airbnb, Google and Facebook use machine learning to delight consumers and restrict the independence of the growth-stage and mid-market companies who end up being relegated to supplier or fulfillment roles in the tech giant ecosystems. Jarvis ML enables these companies to leverage data they already have to reduce the dependence on tech giants while scaling sustainably.” A screenshot of Jarvis ML’s website. Yadav describes Jarvis ML as a fully managed “machine learning-as-a-service” solution designed to allow companies to quickly deploy a personalization engine to their products. The platform leverages algorithms to learn sales and inventory patterns in data that companies feed to it, also building prediction, pricing and promotion models that enable those companies to personalize their websites, apps and advertising as well as concierge services and customer service. Biases of all kinds have been found to arise from personalization engines. Often, they’re a result of data imbalance — a group of customers is underrepresented in the data that’s used to develop the engine. Last year, LinkedIn said it fixed an issue that caused its connection suggestions to become less accurate for people who used the service less often than others. Other research has suggested that, on e-commerce sites, recommendation systems can treat economically disadvantaged customers unfairly compared to customers who make lots of purchases.

    "extractedText": "Amazon has been stuffing AI features into its shopping experience for the past few years now. Today, the company unveiled a new feature called “Help me decide,” which takes into account your searches, browsing, and shopping history on Amazon to suggest products and describe why a particular product is right for you. For example, if you’re shopping for a camping tent and have looked at sleeping bags for four people and stoves, and have bought camping boots, Help me decide would suggest an all-season, four-person warm tent. The tool will initially stick to the price range you’re currently browsing, but it can also suggest cheaper or more expensive items if you choose to see more options. Amazon says the “Help me decide” button will show up after a user has browsed through many similar listings. The button is also located under the “Keep shopping for” option at the top of the homepage. Image Credits:Amazon “Help Me Decide saves you time by using AI to provide product recommendations tailored to your needs after you’ve been browsing several similar items, giving you confidence in your purchase decision,” Daniel Lloyd, vice president of personalization at Amazon, said in a statement. Amazon said it is using large language models along with AWS’ generative AI app service, Bedrock, search service OpenSearch, and recommendation service SageMaker for the tool. The feature will be available to consumers in the U.S. on the Amazon Shopping app on iOS and Android, and on the web. Image Credits:Amazon Over the past year, the e-commerce company has implemented multiple shopping tools to drive more purchases. Last year, it introduced its AI assistant Rufus, which sought to help answer user questions about products. Then in October 2024, it added AI-powered shopping guides for over 100 categories, and this year, it started providing audio product and review summaries.

The algorithm-powered feature, aptly called “Your Personal Sale,” culls and presents the best sales for each user based on factors like their purchase history, geographic location, and browsing behavior. It’s a step beyond the daily emails that Gilt shoppers receive, which already tailor content to the user. It also represents a continued investment in the flash sale model, which other sites like Fab have not been able to sustain. “We’re fully invested in flash. Flash is all about the daily visit,” Gilt CIO Steve Jacobs told us. “We’re investing more in the flash model by creating an every day sale that’s new. People are coming back more frequently, and they’re excited to see what’s in their sale tomorrow.” For users who do check the site daily, a personalized sale roster could be helpful as a way to assess their options quickly, especially given how easy it is to miss a flash sale. And, of course, showing people items that they’re predisposed to like is an easy way to get them buying and coming back for more. E-commerce personalization often blends into the woodwork, taking the form of sidebar recommendations and ads on Facebook showing items similar to the one I bought one from that retailer last week. Gilt’s “Your Personal Sale” turns it into the main event and a destination. “Your Personal Sale” is launching for womenswear and menswear today, with home and kids categories to follow. Gilt is also at work on another personalized sale feature, which will likely go live in a few months’ time. Topics TC Eliza Brooke Associate Editor Eliza Brooke is an associate editor at Fashionista.

    "extractedText": "An A.I.-powered online fashion marketplace, Shoptrue, is launching its website into beta today with plans for a public release early next year. The site blends artificial intelligence and personalized recommendations with taste-driven shopping, the company says, which helps give users a source for style inspiration as well as the ability to create and share outfit ideas with others. Rather than the typical algorithmic approach such as Amazon, which ranks items based on a strong sales history, Shoptrue is A.I.-driven and continually improves its product recommendations based on purchase behaviors and user engagement. That way, users can have more say on what items they see on their curated feeds. The site offers a “One Stop Personal Shop” for the user, which gives fashion suggestions based on their style preferences. Users can eliminate the items they dislike and purchase items directly on Shoptrue through its unified checkout process. Romney Evans, the founder of Shoptrue, told TechCrunch, “Instead of being a top-down recommendation system, where the user is passive, it’s putting the user in the driver’s seat, back into personalization, giving them the controls.” Image Credits:Shoptrue Shoptrue’s individualized shopping experience begins with an onboarding quiz, which includes questions about your style personality, favorite brands, and color preferences– similar to other personalized e-commerce sites, like Stitch Fix. Shoptrue users can then browse a large selection of merchandise from over 2,000 merchants that range from high-end brands like Alexander Wang, Christian Louboutin, Gucci, and Dolce & Gabbana, to affordable retailers like Ross, Kohls, Nordstrom Rack, H&M, and Forever 21. There are also “Shops,” or collections created by Shoptrue’s team of editors, that users can explore for inspiration. For instance, the “Girl’s Night Out” lookbook features trendy miniskirts, strappy heels, tanks, graphic pants, and handbags.

Peer-generated Shops will also roll out when Shoptrue officially launches out of beta. Image Credits: Shoptrue Shoptrue will also soon launch the ability to pre-filter size and fit specifications, so shoppers only see the products in stock that are in their size. This is a natural step for the company as Evans is also the co-founder of True Fit, the personalization company that built a data platform to help online shoppers find the correct sizes for apparel and footwear. Shoptrue users can create a True Fit profile that helps determine what size they are for specific items. As Shoptrue evolves, the company plans to add features based on customer feedback. “We invite shoppers everywhere to join us on this journey. It will take time, but today begins our rollout of an exciting stream of innovation and distinctive experiences that will make it easy to get only what you love. We aspire to delight shoppers and earn their trust as we improve their shopping experience every month and every quarter through innovation, trial and error, and by listening to their feedback,” Evans said. Shoptrue’s beta is available starting today on web only. It isn’t available as a native app on iOS and Android devices yet, however, it’s mobile-optimized. There are plans to launch a native app in 2023, the company told us. With the launch of Shoptrue, Evans has brought on a team of technology and fashion experts, including Brandon Holley, a Condé Nast veteran with over 25 years of experience in fashion, and former Netflix data scientist John Lashlee. Holley is also the founder and CEO of Everywear, a technology platform that’s now incorporated into Shoptrue and helps with custom recommendations and foreseeing purchase behaviors.

Subscribe: Apple Podcasts Spotify RSS All episodes All episodes Details Transcript November 01, 2023 Do you have good AI? That’s “aesthetic intelligence” — not artificial intelligence. Pauline Brown, former chairman of North America for the luxury goods company LVMH, argues that great leaders need to develop “aesthetic intelligence” to stand out among competitors. They need to understand how their products or services can “elicit true delight.” “When you look at the research, the vast majority of reasons that anyone will buy one product over another is based on how that product or service makes the person feel,” she tells IdeaCast host Alison Beard. In this episode, you’ll learn from companies—like Starbucks, Airbnb, and, of course, Apple—that successfully use aesthetics to set their products apart. You’ll also learn why it’s important for leaders or founders—not customers—to define and maintain a company’s aesthetic principles. Brown is the author of the book Aesthetic Intelligence: How to Boost It and Use It in Business and Beyond. Key episode topics include: strategy, creativity, design thinking, Starbucks, Apple, aesthetics, design, customer centricity, consumer research, competition. HBR On Strategy curates the best case studies and conversations with the world’s top business and management experts, to help you unlock new ways of doing business. New episodes every week.

HANNAH BATES: Welcome to HBR On Strategy, case studies and conversations with the world’s top business and management experts, hand-selected to help you unlock new ways of doing business. Do you have good A.I.? I’m not talking about technology. I mean aesthetic intelligence. Pauline Brown argues that, in addition to traditional and emotional intelligence, leaders also need to understand good taste. Literally, how services and products stimulate the five senses to spark delight. Brown was formerly a chairman of the luxury goods company LVMH, whose brands include Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Sephora, and Hennessy, and she’s also the author of the book, Aesthetic Intelligence: How to Boost It and Use It in Business and Beyond. She says that in today’s crowded marketplace, strong aesthetics set companies apart – and not just in the consumer products and luxury sectors. In this episode, you’ll learn from companies – like Starbucks, AirBnB, and, of course, Apple — that successfully used aesthetics to set their products apart. You’ll also learn why it’s important for leaders or founders – not customers – to define and maintain a company’s aesthetic principles. This episode originally aired on HBR IdeaCast in November 2019. Here it is. ALISON BEARD: Welcome to the HBR IdeaCast from Harvard Business Review. I’m Alison Beard.

    "extractedText": "While working at Vetan, a startup helping small- and medium-sized (SMBs) businesses manage employee payroll, Ranti Dev Sharma realized that SMBs often lack the tools to thrive online with organic sales. The cost to hire an agency is beyond their budget, and generating content is costly — both in terms of time and money. “Having a great online presence is critical for e-commerce stores like Shopify and Woo, as online traffic is the bread and butter of their business,” Sharma told TechCrunch in an email interview. “But existing content marketing solutions are not complete and require search engine optimization (SEO) expertise. Businesses need multiple SEO tools and to hire content strategists, writers and agencies to outsource their content marketing work.” So along with Jatin Mehta and Ayush Jasuja, Sharma co-founded SpeedyBrand, which aims to bring “high-quality,” affordable SEO content to SMBs using generative AI. SpeedyBrand today announced that it raised $2.5 million in a funding round led by GV (Google’s venture arm) and Y Combinator that values the company at $15 million post-money. SpeedyBrand’s platform, powered by generative AI, can create custom SEO-optimized content — including websites and social media posts — for brands. Brands first choose a topic. Then they have the platform generate text and suggest images that might be appropriate for the type of content they’re generating. From SpeedyBrand’s dashboard, generated content can be edited and further customized before being published to various channels. An analytics component allows brands to track the performance of the content once it’s live. “The economic slowdown requires cost-effective marketing solutions,” Sharma said. “Speedy is well-positioned to help businesses with an affordable solution.” But there’s reason to be wary of the tech.

Thanks to a phenomenon known as “hallucination,” AI models sometimes confidently make up facts. And, as a result of biases and other imbalances in their training data, text-generating AI can spew toxic, wildly offensive remarks. In another potential problem for brands, generative AI has been shown to plagiarize copyrighted work. One study found that an indirect predecessor to ChatGPT, GPT-2, can be prompted to “copy and paste” entire paragraphs from its training data. Then there’s the matter of generative AI spamming up the internet. As The Verge’s James Vincent wrote in a recent piece, generative AI models are changing the economy of the web — making it cheaper and easier to generate lower-quality content. Newsguard, a company that provides tools for vetting news sources, has exposed hundreds of ad-supported sites with generic-sounding names featuring misinformation created with generative AI. Sharma asserts that SpeedyBrand isn’t a content mill — and that it takes steps to mitigate any toxic content that the platform’s AI might generate. SpeedyBrand’s AI can be personalized to brand tone and generates provably “plagiarism-free” content, he claims, incorporating feedback from content edits to improve future output. To what extent is all this true? It’s tough to say without a third-party audit. But brands, no doubt eager to jump on the generative AI train, appear to be embracing SpeedyBrand. The company, which has a six-person team, has around 50 paying customers and over 1,000 users. Annual recurring revenue stands at $100,000, and Sharma anticipates that it’ll reach $1 million in the next year. That’s impressive considering the competition. SpeedyBrand faces off against Typeface, which recently emerged from stealth with $65 million in venture capital. Startups like Movio, Copysmith, Copy.ai, Sellscale, Jasper, Omneky and Regie.ai, too, are using generative AI to create (ostensibly) better marketing copy, imagery and even video for ads, websites and emails. It’s a large and growing market. Statista reports that 87% of current AI adopters are already using, or considering using, AI for improving th",

    "extractedText": "When you think of e-commerce marketplaces, chances are that the first things that come to mind are storefronts built on websites and apps. But today an e-commerce startup that has never had either — and never plans to — has raised a fistful of cash to continue building out its shopping experience on the platform that has been its growth engine: messaging apps. London-based Threads has raised $20 million in funding for an operation that courts high-end, millennial, mostly female customers with tailored selections of luxury fashion, which it then sells to them on services like WeChat, WhatsApp, Snapchat, Instagram and Apple’s iMessage for their primary interactions with a team of human (not AI) shopping assistants. “We very intentionally didn’t build a website for consumers, just as we haven’t built an app,” founder and CEO Sophie Hill explained in an interview. “The idea behind Threads is curation and convenience. It’s a customer-centric business and it’s built on chat because that is where the customers wanted to be and transact. Chat may not have been used in the way we were using it in 2010” — when the company was founded — “but that was our problem to solve. We had to learn to serve through chat rather than create was for convenient for us as a business.” The company says that it will be using the new funding — led by fashion and millennial-focused fund C Ventures, with participation from Highland Europe (which invests in Matches Fashion, among other related businesses) — to expand its business across the board: hiring more stylists, more engineers to build tech to help the operation run smoother, and creative and other staff to bolster the 90 who already work for the business. But even before now, the company has been growing quite impressively. With customers in 100 countries — 70 percent of them under the age of 35, with Asia one of its fastest-growing regions — Threads says that its average amount people spend in a shopping session (basket size) is a very unshabby $3,000. And because of its success in linking up expensive goods with people willing to buy them, it’s secured relationships with designers and brands like Dior, Fendi, Chopard and some 250 other luxury names to source key items for its clients. As a marketplace, Threads makes commissions from the suppliers when items are sold. Threads materialised (sorry) as a business when founder and CEO Sophie Hill was still working as a buyer for Topshop owner Arcadia, her first job out of university (where she studied sociology). The year was 2010, and even though messaging apps had yet to take off, and well before the ones you likely use today really had any functionality at all, with Instagram and the “stories” format nowhere on the scene, Hill started canvassing opinion among the people she hoped to target. She saw that they were already all avidly using messaging clients on their phones to chat to each other.

San Francisco | October 13-15, 2026 WAITLIST NOW Messaging in the West was relatively feature-free, but Hill could see what was coming around the corner by looking at WeChat, the Chinese app that was well ahead of its time, and that — plus what her target audience was already using — was enough to convince her of how she needed to build her business. Threads has a somewhat unconventional cost base as an e-commerce startup. Without a site and app, its developer team instead is focused on ways of improving the processes that go into the selling that Threads does do: personalized, concierge style services. That means building tech to make tracking items more efficient for customers (that might come in the form of an actual chatbot at some point, Hill said); building a better search engine for the assistants to find specific pieces for Threads clients; and so on. Another area where Threads’ costs are quite different from the typical e-commerce business is in customer acquisition. Hill says the startup company also has never really had a dedicated marketing budget (nor “someone leading the marketing function”). Instead, Threads has grown mainly by word of ",

Subscribe: Apple Podcasts Spotify RSS All episodes All episodes Details Transcript February 18, 2025 Despite all the ways that artificial intelligence promises to improve our lives, many consumers feel anxious and are averse to AI-powered products and services. For marketers and product managers, it’s vital to understand what is driving that resistance to adoption. Julian De Freitas is an assistant professor in the marketing unit at Harvard Business School. He has identified five main ways people see artificial intelligence negatively: that AI is opaque, emotionless, inflexible, autonomous, and not human enough. Through real-life cases and the latest research, he explains how companies can soothe anxieties and encourage consumer adoption. De Freitas the author of the HBR article “Why People Resist Embracing AI.” CURT NICKISCH: Welcome to the HBR IdeaCast from Harvard Business Review. I’m Curt Nickisch. Artificial intelligence is changing business as we know it, but the extent of those changes depends on two things. First, how good the technology gets, and second, how much companies adopt it and consumers actually buy it, and there’s a gap there. According to a Gartner survey, for instance, four out of five corporate strategists say AI will be critical to their success in the near future, but only one out of five said they actually use AI in their day-to-day work. That was a 2023 survey, it’s probably different today. But the point remains, there is, adoption is lagging, and a key reason for that is perception. Many people view AI and automation negatively and resist using them. Today’s guest has studied the psychological barriers to adoption and explains what managers can do to overcome them. Julian De Freitas is an assistant professor at Harvard Business School and he wrote the HBR article, Why People Resist Embracing AI. Julian, hi. JULIAN DE FREITAS: Hi, Curt. Thanks for having me on the show. CURT NICKISCH: Julian, the adoption of technology is an age-old experience for people. We’ve resisted technology many times in the past and have adopted it. Is AI any different from other technologies when it comes to resistance to adoption? JULIAN DE FREITAS: I think the answer is yes, and we’re finding in many cases AI is different from a consumer perception standpoint. What we’re seeing is that in many use cases, people perceive AI as though it is more human-like, as opposed to being this sort of non-living technology. And this has profound implications for a number of marketing problems, such as overcoming barriers to adoption, but also, new ways of unlocking value from the technology that aren’t possible with previous technologies. And then of course, there’s also interesting challenges around the risks, because it’s not actually the case that this is another human. It does fall short of humans in various ways. And so if we treat it as a full-fledged human being, that could also create challenges and risks. CURT NICKISCH: What are the main ways that people see AI as something that they want to drag their feet with, as something they want to resist? JULIAN DE FREITAS: We try to narrow it down to five main barriers. At a high level, I think you can summarize them as, AI is often seen as human-like, but not human enough. Or conversely, it is seen as a little bit too human, too capable. And then there’s one last barrier that’s just about how it’s really difficult to understand. So, the five barriers that myself ",

Climate Rising is all about what businesses are doing, can do, and should do to confront climate change. In this episode, “Extending Apparel Lifespan,” HBS Professor Mike Toffel talks to ThredUp CEO James Reinhart about why ThredUp chose to build a national logistics and technology platform for resale. They also talk about how the company partners with big brands to run their own resale channels and how AI and automation are reshaping the industry. It’s an insightful conversation for anyone interested in sustainability or circular business models. ROBIN PASSIAS: Hi, listeners. Robin Passias here, Cold Call producer. This week on the podcast, we’re sharing an episode of Harvard Business School’s Climate Rising podcast. In this conversation, Professor Mike Toffel speaks with James Reinhart, Co-Founder and CEO of ThredUp, one of the world’s largest online resale platforms for secondhand clothing. We thought it was the perfect time with the holiday season upon us and the results of ThredUp’s 2025 holiday report revealing 40% of holiday budgets will go to secondhand gifts this year. What a wonderful idea to extend product life, reduce waste, and be part of the circular economy. We hope you enjoy and will maybe be inspired to join in on this year’s thrifting as gifting trend. From all of us here at Cold Call, may you have a happy, healthy holiday season. We’ll see you back here on January 6, 2026, with all new episodes. Thanks for listening. Editor’s Note: This podcast originally aired on June 4, 2025. MIKE TOFFEL: James, thank you so much for joining us on Climate Rising. JAMES REINHART: Thanks for having me, great to be here. MIKE TOFFEL: James, why don’t we start with a little bit of your background. So, you started ThredUp almost 20 or 15 years ago or so. And so, what were you doing before that? JAMES REINHART: Yeah, I started the business out of business school. So I was, you know, I was working on the business while trying to get all my casework done. So, I didn’t get the best grades, you know, my final year of business school because of that. But before that, though, I worked in public education. So, I helped start a charter school serving low-income kids. I was a teacher for a few years. I was very focused on the intersection of private and public partnerships, right? And so education was a passion of mine and I thought the education system in this country could do better. And so, I was very much focused on that. And I think there’s a thorough line in my career around trying to do well and do good at the same time. MIKE TOFFEL: Right. So, then you were here at Harvard, HBS, and at Kennedy School doing a joint degree, the three-year program. JAMES REINHART: Correct, yep. I was there. I started at the Kennedy School and then did two years at the business school. MIKE TOFFEL: So, you were here, and you were drumming up this idea while you were a business school / Kennedy School student.

    "extractedText": "Before founding dipp, Jennifer Chen and Mikhail Abramov spent 15 years working as art directors in New York City. During that time, Chen says they realized that the marketing, sales and design process has stayed the same, despite new technology and tools being introduced to the market, and is often riddled with bottlenecks. “Salespeople have sales needs, they communicate with the marketing team and then once the marketing team has a direction, they brief a designer, then the designer goes back to the marketer, and then the marketer goes back to the designer,” she said. “There’s that vicious cycle that slows down the entire process because nobody understands the needs and workflow of the other department.” Dipp was launched three years ago to automate much of that workflow and allow marketing and design teams to collaborate more effectively, while focusing on their own performance metrics. For example, if a marketing team wants to update a price on their ad, all they need to do is enter it into a spreadsheet instead of asking a designer. The Taipei-based startup recently raised $1.5 million in seed funding from investors, including SparkLabs Taiwan, Palm Drive Capital and content-tech unicorn Tezign, and will launch generative AI–powered features soon. To use dipp, brands first set up a brand guideline with information such as fonts, colors and layout (or they can upload an Adobe Photoshop file). That data is then turned into a dipp file with everything remaining editable. Then prices and other information for ads are uploaded into a spreadsheet, with each row representing a product, so visual assets can be edited in batches. This helps marketing and design teams keep up with the massive amount of visual content that is needed to sell online — Chen said brands typically generate 300 to 500 images at a time, which dipp can help them do in minutes. Dipp’s team. Image Credits: dipp The brands dipp works with are typically Fortune 500 companies in apparel and beauty selling a large number of products, or upward of 500 SKUs. They have high product rotation rates, often with weekly launches of 20 or more products, and sell on three or more marketplaces, alongside social media advertising campaigns. Chen says most have large sales and marketing teams, but a shortage of designers. Its customers include Levi’s, Estée Lauder and Rakuten. Dipp also works with e-commerce enablers, or agencies that help brands distribute products across multiple channels. Since its launch, dipp has primarily focused on Taiwan but is expanding into Southeast Asia, with new clients in Singapore, the Philippines and Thailand. Dipp started in New York, but the team decided to move to Taiwan after getting into Taipei-based accelerator AppWorks because of the market potential it saw in Asia. For example, brands here hold a high number of sales promotions. “Throughout the year, it’s not just Black Friday or Christmas; there’s a sale every month,” Chen said. “There’s a busy season starting in June that goes all the way to Chinese New Year.” Techcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Each marketplace has its own unique guidelines for visual content, including file sizes and dimensions. That information is embedded into dipp’s platform, so brands can automate their ads to fit different requirements. Dipp is now working on integrating generative AI into its platform to help address gaps between marketing and design departments. For example, it will allow marketers to use prompts to generate images as a first draft of ideas to present to designers. It also automates the process of reviewing designs, or checking details like character limit and formatting to meet the requirements of different marketplaces a",

    "extractedText": "Spangle, an AI e-commerce startup founded by former Bolt CEO Maju Kuruvilla, has raised $15 million in a new funding round, valuing the company at $100 million after the investment. Led by NewRoad Capital Partners, the all-equity Series A round comes over a year after the Seattle-based startup raised a $6 million seed round at a $30 million pre-money valuation. Madrona, DNX Ventures, Streamlined Ventures, and strategic angel investors also participated, bringing total funding to $21 million, according to the startup. Retailers are facing changes in how consumers discover products online, as AI tools, social platforms, and recommendation engines increasingly influence buying decisions before shoppers reach a brand’s website. Kuruvilla (pictured above) aims to address this with Spangle — positioning it as software that helps retailers personalize shopping experiences based on that context as shoppers move through their sites, using real-time, AI-generated product recommendations and layouts. Since emerging from stealth in March of last year, Spangle has signed nine enterprise customers, including fashion retailers Revolve, Alexander Wang, and Steve Madden, whose combined online sales total about $3.8 billion, Kuruvilla said in an interview. Traffic flowing through Spangle’s platform has grown about 57% month-on-month, with all customers expanding their use of the software, and the startup said it quadrupled its annualized revenue in the fourth quarter, though it did not disclose revenue figures. At the core of Spangle’s approach is a simple idea: Instead of sending shoppers to pre-built product or category pages, brands route traffic to what is essentially a blank page. Spangle’s AI fills that page in real time using a proprietary model called ProductGPT, drawing on signals such as where the shopper came from, what they searched for or clicked on, and how similar visitors have behaved, to surface products, recommendations, and content tailored to that moment. Image Credits:Spangle Kuruvilla told TechCrunch that brands using Spangle are seeing close to a 50% increase in revenue per visit, a doubling of return on ad spend, and a 15% increase in average order value.

Plus, meet the hundreds of startups innovating across every sector. San Francisco | October 13-15, 2026 WAITLIST NOW “We are future-proofing the brand,” Kuruvilla said, adding that Spangle trains its AI model on each retailer’s catalog and performance data, allowing shopping experiences to adapt automatically. Spangle’s software has helped Revolve adapt shopping experiences in real time, driving about a 60% improvement in return on ad spend and a 50% increase in revenue per visit, said Ryan Pabelona, the retailer’s vice president of performance marketing. Before starting Spangle in 2024, Kuruvilla served as CEO of the one-click checkout company Bolt and earlier spent more than a decade at Amazon, where he worked on large-scale commerce and AI systems. He founded the startup alongside CTO Fei Wang, a former Amazon principal engineer who worked on Alexa and customer service technologies and later served as CTO at Saks Off 5th. Kuruvilla said their experience running commerce and payments platforms shaped Spangle’s focus on building infrastructure rather than incremental fixes. Some, he added, view the startup as a kind of Shopify for AI-powered commerce. Spangle’s approach also aligns with a shift toward shopping mediated by AI tools such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and several browser-based agents. As consumers increasingly rely on chatbots and automated agents to search for and compare products, Kuruvilla said brands will need software that can respond dynamically to both human shoppers and machines, rather than serving the same static pages to every visitor. Kuruvilla told TechCrunch that Spangle became viable only in the past two years as three major shifts converged: consumers growing comfortable discovering products through AI tools, a rapid proliferation of discovery channels beyond Google and Meta, and advances in AI technology that have sharply lowered the cost and latency of generating real-time experiences. Together, he said",

More and more companies are turning to pricing algorithms to maximize profits. But many are unaware of a big downside. Marco Bertini, a marketing professor at Esade Business School in Barcelona, says constant price shifts can actually hurt the perception of your brand and its products. He warns that employing AI and machine learning without considering human psychology can damage your relationship with customers.

Here it is. CURT NICKISCH: Welcome to the HBR IdeaCast from Harvard Business Review. I’m Curt Nickisch. When I was a teenager on a sports team, our team bus stopped at a McDonald’s restaurant. Waiting in line, we noticed that the board that showed the prices for the French fries and hamburgers had little wheels for the numbers. Whoever set the prices, spun the wheels to show the right number. One of us joked that they probably rolled the prices higher when they saw the bus pulling up. And as you do, when you’re trying to be funnier than the next kid, we started imagining the prices bouncing around like stocks that if you were shopping at McDonald’s, you’d have to yell, “Buy now!”, when the price of a big Mac dropped to where you wanted to swoop in and pick one up. What was totally laughable to us at the time is actually become the norm of pricing today. Algorithms that can change prices by the minute are commonplace. It’s not just airfares and hotel rates anymore. Check your ride sharing app a minute later, and you can get a wildly different number. Leave items in your online shopping car",

Some startups accrued value at lightning speed this week, and we got confirmation that defense tech is red hot. Most interesting startup stories from the week Image Credits:Kelly Sullivan / Getty Images Many startup stories this week occurred in Y Combinator’s orbit in some way. Also, Israel once again lived up to its “Start-Up Nation” reputation. That was fast: No-code website-building platform Wix acquired 6-month-old, bootstrapped vibe-coding startup Base44 — both Israeli companies — for $80 million in cash. That was fast, too: In just three months, Ramp’s valuation jumped to $16 billion following its Series E, up from $13 billion when the spend management startup did a secondary sale earlier this year. Friends and foes: New details emerged on Meta’s $14.3 billion deal to acquire 49% of startup Scale AI, including a potential dividend payout. We also learned that OpenAI was dropping Scale AI as a data provider following the deal. Frenemies: The U.S. Department of Defense awarded a contract worth up to $200 million directly to OpenAI, which could further strain the startup’s relationship with Microsoft.

San Francisco | October 13-15, 2026 WAITLIST NOW ICYMI: Out of all the teams presenting at YC’s recent Spring 2025 Demo Day, here are 11 startups that investors have been talking about. Didn’t happen: People are also still talking about the police shutting down the YC Demo Day after-party that controversial AI startup Cluely tried to throw; or as its CEO told TechCrunch, “the most legendary party that never happened.” Most interesting VC and funding news this week HelsingImage Credits:Helsing Most funding news was driven by either defense tech, AI, or both, but there were also some surprises. Plus, one VC firm is aiming high for its next fund. Good intuition: Applied Intuition, a company making software for autonomous vehicles, secured a $600 million Series F and tender offer at a $15 billion valuation. New tune: Munich-based defense tech startup Helsing closed a €600 million investment led by Prima Materia, the VC firm of Spotify’s founder Daniel Ek, which valued Helsing at €12 billion. New unicorn: Israeli observability startup Coralogix became a unicorn after raising a $115 million Series E, which it will use to double its headcount in India, where 100 of its 550 employees are currently based. Toldja: Mach Industries, a 2-year-old defense tech startup, confirmed having raised a $100 million round of funding led by Khosla Ventures and Bedrock at a $470 million valuation. Money flows: Aspora, a startup formerly known as Vance and focused on facilitating remittances from the Indian diaspora, closed a $50 million Series B co-led by Sequoia and Greylock at a $500 million valuation. Change of heart: Sword Health, an AI-powered digital health startup that began as a virtual physical therapy solution, locked in $40 million at a $4 billion valuation in a funding round led by returning investor General Catalyst. It also pushed back its IPO plans to at least 2028. Multiplier effect: Multiplier Holdings announced having raised $27.5 million across seed and Series A rounds after joining the growing trend of buying legacy service businesses — in its case, accounting firms — and scaling them with AI. Stock where you shop: Grifin, a startup whose app helps users buy stock from brands they shop at, such as Walmart, secured $11 million in a Series A round. Out of Sweden: Polar, a payment infrastructure platform for developers and AI-first businesses, raised a $10 million seed round led by Accel. Its CEO previously co-founded Tictail, which was acquired by Shopify in 2018. Bullish: Global VC Endeavor Catalyst is seeking to raise $300 million for its fifth fund. This would be its largest yet, as it looks to deepen its bet on fast-growing startups in emerging markets.

    "extractedText": "If there was any doubt, the generative AI bubble did not burst in 2024. Investments in generative AI, which encompasses a range of AI-powered apps, tools, and services to generate text, images, videos, speech, music, and more, reached new heights last year. According to data from financial tracker PitchBook compiled for TechCrunch, generative AI companies worldwide raised $56 billion from VCs in 2024 across 885 deals. That raw cash total is a new record for the segment. It’s up 92% from 2023, when investors poured $29.1 billion into generative AI startups across 691 deals. “We aren’t seeing a slowdown in generative AI funding, as big names like OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI continue to secure major raises and release new, competitive products,” said Ali Javaheri, an emerging technology analyst at PitchBook, in an interview. Deal value in Q4 2024 soared to $31.1 billion with the closure of mammoth rounds like Databricks’ $10 billion Series J, xAI’s $6 billion Series C, Anthropic’s $4 billion strategic investment from Amazon, and OpenAI’s $6.6 billion round. Mergers and acquisitions were a small share of generative AI investments in 2024: $951 million, per PitchBook data. To be clear, that’s exclusive of the various “acqui-hire” deals executed by Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. Google reportedly paid $2.7 billion to hire much of chatbot startup Character AI‘s staff and license its technology, while Microsoft is said to have spent $650 million licensing Inflection‘s AI models and hiring its CEO, Mustafa Suleyman. U.S. companies attracted the bulk of generative AI backing last year. Startups outside the U.S. nabbed just $6.2 billion of all 2024 VC investments in the market. There were some big winners, however, like Beijing-based Moonshot AI ($1 billion in February), French startup Mistral (~$640 million in June), Cologne-based company DeepL ($300 million in May), Shanghainese firm MiniMax ($600 million in March), and Tokyo-based Sakana AI (~$214 million in September).

Javaheri believes that the generative AI sector risks becoming oversaturated with startups in exceedingly similar (or even identical) verticals. To his point, no fewer than four companies developing AI coding assistants — Augment, Magic, Codeium, and Poolside — closed rounds exceeding $100 million last year. And a host of generative media startups (e.g., Black Forest Labs, ElevenLabs) have recently secured tens of millions of dollars in funding at sky-high valuations. The trend may not be sustainable as investor pressure to show appreciable revenue growth increases. According to Javaheri, technical challenges and the vast computing costs needed to stay competitive may pose additional challenges for generative AI ventures. “Only the best-funded startups can continue to keep up with the pace needed for the most innovative models,” he added. “Most of the high valuations are thus going to come from the infrastructure layer.” That is, of course, very good news for “infrastructure layer” generative AI players, which did quite well for themselves in 2024. Data center startups like Crusoe ($600 million in December) and Lambda ($320 million in February) represented some of the generative AI market’s largest rounds. Investment firm KKR predicts that soaring demand for data centers to support AI will boost global spending in the sector to $250 billion a year. TechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

    "extractedText": "It’s been three years since OpenAI released ChatGPT and kicked off a surge in innovation and attention on AI. Since then, optimists have regularly claimed that AI will become a critical part of the enterprise software industry, and so enterprise AI startups mushroomed on the back of immense amounts of investment. But enterprises are still struggling to see the benefit of adopting these new AI tools. An MIT survey in August found that 95% of enterprises weren’t getting a meaningful return on their investments in AI. So when will businesses start seeing real benefits from using and integrating AI? TechCrunch surveyed 24 enterprise-focused VCs, and they overwhelmingly think 2026 will be the year when enterprises start to meaningfully adopt AI, see value from it, and increase their budgets for the tech. Enterprise VCs have been saying that for three years now. Will 2026 actually be different? Let’s hear what they have to say: What enterprise-related trends do you expect to take off in 2026? Kirby Winfield, founding general partner, Ascend: Enterprises are realizing that LLMs are not a silver bullet for most problems. Just because Starbucks can use Claude to write their own CRM software doesn’t mean they should. We’ll focus on custom models, fine tuning, evals, observability, orchestration, and data sovereignty. Molly Alter, partner, Northzone: A subset of enterprise AI companies will shift from product businesses to AI consulting. These companies may start with a specific product, such as AI customer support or AI coding agents. But once they have enough customer workflows running off their platform, they can replicate the forward-deployed engineer model with their own team to build additional use cases for customers. In other words, many specialized AI product companies will become generalist AI implementers.

San Francisco | October 13-15, 2026 WAITLIST NOW Marcie Vu, partner, Greycroft: We’re very excited about the opportunity in voice AI. Voice is a far more natural, efficient, and expressive way for people to communicate with each other and with machines. We’ve spent decades typing on computers and staring at screens, but speech is how we engage in the real world. I am eager to see how builders reimagine products, experiences, and interfaces with voice as the primary mode of interaction with intelligence. Alexa von Tobel, founder and managing partner, Inspired Capital: 2026 will be the year AI reshapes the physical world — especially in infrastructure, manufacturing, and climate monitoring. We are moving from a reactive world to a predictive one, where physical systems can sense problems before they become failures. Lonne Jaffe, managing director, Insight Partners: We’re watching how frontier labs approach the application layer. A lot of people assumed labs would just train models and hand them off for others to build on, but that doesn’t seem to be how they are thinking about it. We may see frontier labs shipping more turnkey applications directly into production in domains like finance, law, healthcare, and education than people expect. Tom Henriksson, general partner, OpenOcean: If I had to pick one word for quantum in 2026, it’s momentum. Trust in quantum advantage is building fast, with companies publishing roadmaps to demystify the tech. But don’t expect major software breakthroughs yet; we still need more hardware performance to cross that threshold. Which areas are you looking to invest in? Emily Zhao, principal, Salesforce Ventures: We are targeting two distinct frontiers — AI entering the physical world and the next evolution of model research. Michael Stewart, managing partner, M12: Future datacenter technology. For the last year or so, we’ve been standing up a few new investments that signal our interest in future “token factory” technology, with an eye towards what can really advance how efficiently and cleanly they run. This is going to continue in 2026 and beyond, in categories that include everything within the walls of the data center: cooling, compute, memory, and networking within and between site",

    "extractedText": "Amazon is testing short-form AI-powered audio product summaries on select product pages, the company announced on Wednesday. The audio summaries are voiced by what Amazon calls “AI-powered shopping experts” that discuss key product features, customer reviews, and information from across the web. The new AI product summaries can be accessed by tapping the “Hear the highlights” button in the Amazon Shopping app. Amazon will test the feature on products that typically require consideration before purchase, the company says. The idea behind the feature is to help Amazon customers save time while shopping and get important information through a conversational, discussion-style format. “The feature makes product research fun and convenient — it’s like having helpful friends discuss potential purchases to make your shopping easier, even if you’re multitasking or on the go,” the company wrote in their blog post. Image Credits:Amazon The summaries are currently available on select products to some U.S. customers. Amazon plans to roll out the feature to more products and to additional U.S. customers in the coming months. The company explains that the feature uses large language models (LLMs) to generate scripts by pulling from customer reviews and information from the web, and then transforms this content into short-form audio clips. Amazon says the new feature joins its current suite of AI-powered shopping features, which includes Rufus, its generative AI shopping assistant, and Interests, an AI feature that monitors new products that match your interests.

    "extractedText": "While many venture firms seem to only have eyes for AI these days, Nexus Venture Partners is deliberately splitting its focus for its new $700 million fund. The firm will back AI startups and seek out India-focused startups in consumer, fintech, and digital infrastructure. AI has soaked up most of the venture capital raised globally and the 20-year-old VC firm also sees AI as a defining technological shift. But it argues crowding into a single, overheated category carries its own risks. India’s digital economy provides a counterbalance: an expanding market where AI adoption is rising and opportunities remain more diverse. For Nexus, that balance is rooted in its origins. The Delaware-headquartered firm, with offices in Menlo Park, Mumbai, and Bengaluru, has operated as a single fund and an integrated U.S.–India team since its founding in 2006. It backs early-stage software and India-focused startups from the same pool of capital. Over time, its cross-border software bets have encompassed a range from infrastructure and developer tools to AI agent startups. U.S. portfolio includes companies such as Postman, Apollo, MinIO, Giga, and Firecrawl, which have become widely adopted in developer tooling and AI infrastructure. Meanwhile, its India portfolio has broadened across consumer, fintech, logistics, and digital infrastructure. Some of its bets there include Zepto, Delhivery, Rapido, Turtlemint, and Infra.Market. “AI is a huge inflection point, and we are anchoring on that,” Jishnu Bhattacharjee, a managing partner at Nexus Venture Partners in the U.S., told TechCrunch in an interview. “But we are also seeing that many of these AI innovations are actually getting used to serve the masses better.” Techcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | October 13-15, 2026 WAITLIST NOW Nexus manages $3.2 billion in capital across its funds and has invested in more than 130 companies over the years. The firm has recorded more than 30 exits to date, including several IPOs, underscoring the depth of its early-stage, long-horizon approach. Abhishek Sharma, a managing partner at Nexus Venture Partners in the U.S., told TechCrunch the firm’s sweet spot remains inception to seed and Series A, often beginning with checks as small as a few hundred thousand dollars or around $1 million. Nexus, which operates with an eight-member investment team, began with a $100 million fund and has kept its fund size at $700 million since launching Fund VII in 2023. It typically raises every 2.5 to 3 years. Bhattacharjee said the reason for keeping the eighth fund the same size was the firm believes $700 million is the right amount for its early-stage strategy. “We don’t want to raise money for the sake of raising,” he noted. Even though India’s AI journey is not as advanced as the U.S.’s in many areas, Nexus believes India could leapfrog in several parts of the AI ecosystem. Bhattacharjee underlined the country’s large talent pool, rising digital infrastructure, and demand for localized models that support India’s many languages and service needs. These dynamics, he said, are pushing Indian startups to build AI applications and agents faster, often atop open source tools and emerging domestic AI infrastructure companies. The partners pointed to companies backed by Nexus, such as Zepto and Neysa, to illustrate how AI is taking shape in India. They said Zepto, the quick-commerce platform, uses AI extensively across its operations — from customer support to routing and fulfillment — demonstrating how consumer businesses are becoming deeply AI-native. Besides, infrastructure players like Neysa are emerging to address India-specific needs, including sovereign AI workloads, localized data handling, and support for the country’s many languages. Nexus did not share fund metrics. The partners said its funds have been realizing significant enough returns over the years to largely fill this fund from returning limited partners. The firm’s LP base spans the U.S., Europe, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Japan. Topics AI, Enterprise, Fintech, India, Nexus Venture Partners, Startups, United St",

Anthropic on Friday announced a deal with Munich, Germany-based global insurance conglomerate Allianz to bring “responsible AI” to the insurance industry. The parties declined to share financial terms of the deal. The partnership is made up of three specific initiatives. The first is making Claude Code, Anthropic’s AI-powered coding tool, available to all of Allianz’s employees. Anthropic and Allianz will also build custom AI agents for Allianz employees that can execute multistep workflows with a human in the loop. This partnership also includes an AI system that logs all AI interactions to keep the AI transparent and ensure that information is readily available for regulatory or other needs. “With this partnership, Allianz is taking a decisive step to address critical AI challenges in insurance,” Oliver Bäte, CEO of Allianz SE, said in the company’s press release. “Anthropic’s focus on safety and transparency complements our strong dedication to customer excellence and stakeholder trust. Together, we are building solutions that prioritize what matters most to our customers while setting new standards for innovation and resilience.” This is just the latest enterprise deal Anthropic has landed in recent months.

San Francisco | October 13-15, 2026 WAITLIST NOW In December, the company inked a $200 million deal to bring its AI models to data cloud company Snowflake and its customers. Shortly after, it announced a multi-year partnership with the consulting firm Accenture. In October, it signed a deal with consulting firm Deloitte to bring its Claude chatbot to the firm’s 500,000 employees. That same month, Anthropic signed a deal with IBM to bring its AI models into the latter’s products. The race for AI enterprise dominance is clearly on, and Anthropic appears to be winning — so far at least. Anthropic holds 40% of enterprise AI market share, according to a December survey from Anthropic investor Menlo Ventures, and 54% of the market share for AI coding. Anthropic market share increased throughout last year. When Menlo’s original survey came out in July, the company held a 32% market share for overall enterprise LLM use. Google launched its dedicated enterprise AI product, Gemini Enterprise, in October. At the time, the company touted that the product suite already had customers, including fintech Klarna, design software company Figma, and cruise line operator Virgin Voyages, among others. OpenAI launched its enterprise version of ChatGPT, ChatGPT Enterprise, in 2023. Recently, the company reportedly expressed deep concern in an internal memo that Google Gemini’s success was starting to encroach on its business. Shortly after, the company released a report that said enterprise use of ChatGPT had surged 8x in the past year. A recent TechCrunch investor survey found that enterprise-focused VCs overwhelmingly think that 2026 will be the year that enterprises start to see a meaningful return on their investment into AI products. While Anthropic seems to be a clear favorite at the moment, this year will likely be telling of what the enterprise AI market — and its competitive landscape — will look like in the future.

    "extractedText": "OpenAI held its annual dev day on Monday, where the company rolled out its plan to build apps into ChatGPT. The demo was impressive, showing how programs like Spotify and Figma can be called or discovered without leaving the ChatGPT window. With so much of the tech world barreling toward AI integration, OpenAI’s demo was the best picture yet of what an AI-first internet might actually look like, with interfaces like ChatGPT querying information and executing commands directly. If you’re watching closely, you may have noticed that there’s a lot of room in this system for money to change hands. Just last week, the company launched Instant Checkout, an agentic shopping system that serves as payment infrastructure for one-off purchases, plugging in any stores that sell through Shopify, Etsy, or Stripe. Now, apps provide the front-end infrastructure, letting service providers build their own interface into ChatGPT. In short, OpenAI now has all the pieces in place for AI-driven commerce, establishing ChatGPT as a place customers go to buy and retailers go to sell. It’s a huge new line of business for the company — and one with huge implications for the tech industry. In this world, OpenAI isn’t just competing with Google and Anthropic, but with Amazon and Wal-Mart. If you look at OpenAI’s pending app partners in the launch announcement, you can see how far the vision reaches. ChatGPT will be able to call you a cab through Uber, book a trip on Expedia, call a plumber or locksmith through Thumbtack, and order groceries from Instacart, prepared food from DoorDash, or big-box goods from Target. Without too much more work, ChatGPT could become a portal for most of its users’ discretionary spending. If it works, this would be worth a lot more than just a $20-a-month subscription. The precise terms of the arrangement are still unclear, but like any app store, OpenAI is well-positioned to get a portion of any money spent on its platform. ChatGPT is also recommending products, drawing on its wealth of data about its users, which tips the balance of power between OpenAI and retailers even more. In Ben Thompson’s terms, ChatGPT becomes a super-aggregator, funneling customers to retailers and providing an entry point for ever-larger amounts of commerce. OpenAI has lots of potential lines of business to pursue, but it’s no exaggeration to say that AI-driven commerce is one of the most lucrative options. OpenAI isn’t the only company with an eye on this prospect. On the same day as the ChatGPT announcement, Adobe released a report predicting that this year’s holiday would be dominated by AI-assisted shopping, with shoppers turning to chatbots instead of search engines to find the best deals available. A separate report from Mastercard dubbed agentic commerce as a “new competitive arena” for finance. Google has already launched its own competing protocol for agentic commerce called AP2, which arrives with a broader scope but less momentum than OpenAI’s version. The simplest version of AI-driven shopping is using ChatGPT to find products in place of search: If you’re looking for a canvas tennis shoe under $80, ChatGPT can find it for you just as easily as Google Search. But AI systems don’t need to be passive. The AP2 specification includes a provision for agent-initiated purchases, if you want an agent to buy concert tickets as soon as they become available, say, or book a flight as soon as it falls below a certain price. Of course, there could be agents on the other side of the transaction too, negotiating with purchasing agents for the best deal, and willing to bundle goods under the right circumstances. If retailers and customers are willing to take the leap, the changes could extend pretty far beyond a simple “buy” button.

    "extractedText": "With holiday shopping on the horizon, OpenAI and Perplexity both announced AI shopping features this week, which integrate into their existing chatbots to help users research potential purchases. The tools are markedly similar to one another. OpenAI suggests that users could ask ChatGPT for help finding a “new laptop suitable for gaming under $1000 with a screen that’s over 15 inches,” or they can share photos of a high-end garment and ask for something similar at a lower price point. Perplexity, meanwhile, is playing up how its chatbot’s memory can augment shopping-related searches for its users, suggesting that someone could ask for recommendations tailored to what the chatbot already knows about them, like where they live or what they do for work. Adobe predicted that AI-assisted online shopping will grow by 520% this holiday season, which could be a boon for AI shopping startups like Phia, Cherry, or Deft (rebranded as Onton) — but with OpenAI and Perplexity pushing further into AI shopping experiences, are these startups in danger? Zach Hudson, CEO of the interior design shopping tool Onton, thinks that AI shopping startups with a specialized niche will still provide a better experience to users than general-purpose tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity. “Any model or knowledge graph is only as good as its data sources,” Hudson told TechCrunch. “Right now, ChatGPT and LLM-based tools like Perplexity piggyback off existing search indexes like Bing or Google. That makes them really only as good as the first few results that come back from those indexes.” (Perplexity noted to TechCrunch that it has its own search index.) Daydream CEO and longtime e-commerce executive Julie Bornstein agrees — she remarked to TechCrunch over the summer that she always viewed search as “the forgotten child” of the fashion industry, since it never worked particularly well.

San Francisco | October 13-15, 2026 WAITLIST NOW “Fashion … is uniquely nuanced and emotional — finding a dress you love is not the same as finding a television,” Bornstein told TechCrunch on Tuesday. “That level of understanding for fashion shopping comes from domain-specific data and merchandising logic that grasps silhouettes, fabrics, occasions, and how people build outfits over time.” AI shopping startups develop their own datasets so that their tools are trained on higher-quality data — something that’s easier to achieve when you’re attempting to catalog fashion or furniture, rather than the sum of all human knowledge. In Hudson’s case, Onton developed a data pipeline to catalog hundreds of thousands of interior design products in a cleaner manner, helping to train its internal models with better data. But if AI shopping startups don’t pursue that level of specialization, Hudson thinks they’re bound to be overshadowed. “If you’re using only off-the-shelf LLMs and a conversational interface, it’s very hard to see how a startup can compete with the larger companies,” Hudson said. The advantage for OpenAI and Perplexity, however, is that their customers are already using their tools — plus, their large presence lets them ink deals with major retailers from the get-go. While Daydream and Phia redirect customers to retailers’ websites to complete their purchases — sometimes earning affiliate revenue — OpenAI and Perplexity have partnerships with Shopify and PayPal, respectively, allowing users to check out within the conversational interface. These companies, which depend on mammoth amounts of expensive compute power to operate, are still trying to figure out a path to profitability. If they take inspiration from Google and Amazon, then it makes sense to look toward e-commerce as an option — retailers could pay them to advertise their products within search results. But eventually, that could just exacerbate the existing issues that customers have with search. “Vertical models — whether in fashion, travel, or home goods — will outperform because they’re tuned to real consumer decision-making,” Bornstein said.

    "extractedText": "The boom in e-commerce post-pandemic meant shops moved online. However, some merchants ended up with dozens of separate app providers to accommodate everything from supply chains, to inventory, to marketing. The founders of Shop Circle realized this and either built or bought many such apps. The company has now raised $60 million in a Series B fundraise led by Nextalia Ventures in order to scale up this strategy. With this funding, Shop Circle has also completed the acquisition of Aiden, an AI-powered, “guided-selling” software used by such e-commerce giants as LG, Prenatal, and Intersport, among others. Shop Circle claims its year-on-year revenues have increased by 110%, which helped it raise funds, as did its focus on commerce-centric products powered by the increasing power of generative AI integration. It also has been profitable for two consecutive years. “Our main solutions range from AI-driven product discovery, primarily for commerce, up-selling, review management, inventory management, and the strength is that all the software comes together under one unified Shop Circle platform,” said CEO and co-founder Luca Cartechini, who co-founded the company with Luca Cartechini. Asked about their competitors, he said: “We do have several competitors for each of the category … But none of them have all the products under one platform.” In fact, part of Shop Circle’s success lies in its deep integration with Shopify: “Shopify is a partner for us and we’re the largest provider of solutions in the Shopify app store, basically the App Store of Shopify,” he said.

    "extractedText": "GSH Admin Desktop Support & Services As our world continues to become more digitally evolved, the retail industry has been undergoing unprecedented change. Artificial Intelligence, augmented reality, and blockchain are just a few areas where constant improvements in terms of retail technology are being made. It is not wrong to assume that in the coming time, technology will be the driving force behind all sorts of industries. For this reason, it is essential to recognize evolving technology trends and innovations. The quicker we understand them and how they work, the easier it becomes for us to adapt accordingly. To help you better understand what the future will look like in terms of technology, we have underlined the top 6 trends in retail technology in 2023 for you in this blog. Advancement of Web 3.0 Web 3.0 is the third generation of the world wide web, which is to be accessible to everyone and is built on blockchain technologies. A decentralized web allows users to connect to the internet without needing a central authority. This will give them greater control over their online experience and data. Web 3.0 is secure and is used for various applications by individuals. Its most common usage as a retail technology is seen in supply chain management and voting systems. The application of Web 3.0 is expected to increase with time, and it is likely that in the coming years, it will enable new models of ownership and governance. An Increase in TikTok Marketing We have seen how TikTok started merely as an app to make videos for entertainment purposes. However, within just a few years, it has gained immense popularity and is now used extensively for marketing. This is due to its global usage. TikTok has become one of the best ways to reach potential customers. It is for this reason and the fact that it allows you to practice your humor and creativity freely that TikTok is expected to replace conventional marketing methods entirely in the next few years. The application currently has 2 billion downloads. This gives businesses a reason to promote their production of this app. Moreover, TikTok provides companies with an informal and fun way to reach potential customers. This creates a personalized relationship between potential customers and a brand, and they can get more information regarding the product/service. Artificial Intelligence will Shape the Retail industry Another retail technology trend we can expect to see in 2023 and beyond is the significant impact artificial intelligence will have on the retail industry. The use of chatbots and automated customer services with artificial Intelligence has already changed how companies interact with potential customers. Unlike previously, consumers do not have to wait for a customer representative to answer their queries. A report by Forbes said that Artificial Intelligence is likely to be incorporated within 95% of businesses by 2021. This showcases that if retailers want to stay in a competitive market, they would have to include artificial Intelligence, too, since almost everyone else would be doing it. More than that, artificial Intelligence finds its purpose in carrying out essential business tasks. One of its major applications is to predict the customer demand for companies, and they can then manage their production and inventories accordingly. This increases efficiency and reduces wastage, which is something almost all firms are moving towards as a primary objective. Artificial Intelligence also comes in handy in providing businesses with consumer insights that help them make better decisions. This would be because they can now predict consumer preferences and habits. Cashless Transactions Bank cards and mobile money applications have increased the number of cashless transactions that take place in the market to a great extent. This number is expected to only increase in 2023 as financial literacy increases. More retailers are adopting methods where customers can pay for their purchases using a card because of its ease and the problems it caters to. Customers no longer have to worry about the hassle of going to an ATM to get their money or gauge the amount of cash they should keep in hand for a shopping trip. They need to carry their card with them. Increase in Quantum Computing Quantum computing uses quantum mechanical phenomena such as entanglement to carry out different operations with the data on hand. For businesses, it means solving various problems quickly and dealing with tasks like analyzing customer data, optimizing supply chains, and forecasting customer demand. Quantum computers can process a large amount of data in a short time, which is why there is great potential for greater application. It is also secure, which is why many businesses are exploring quantum computing to make their operations more efficient to remain in the competition.

The growth is fueled by the rising adoption of automation and personalized retail services to cut costs and improve customer satisfaction Utilizing autonomous mobile robots (AMR) for in-store automation: Approximately 150,000 mobile robots are expected to be put into use within physical retail stores by 2025, with 90% of retailers planning to boost their investments in automation in the near future Retail market expansion fueled by delivery robots: The market share of delivery robots in the retail sector is estimated to surpass $1 billion by 2032. Prominent companies like Serve Robotics and Nuro have formed strategic collaborations with major retail industry leaders like Kroger and 7-Eleven, aiming to transform and modernize their delivery services Transforming retail inventory management with AI robots: The utilization of AI-driven robots for inventory control is a significant development in the retail industry. Pioneering companies such as Brain Corp, Simbe Robotics, and Bossa Nova Robotics are taking the lead in this area Leading retailers embrace customer service robots: By the year 2025, 80 out of the world’s top 250 retailers will incorporate customer service robots in their physical stores or consider it as an option. Forward-thinking retailers are reimagining their physical store spaces in not only the display of products but also giving customers the chance to interact with new offerings. Revolutionizing retail shelf management through AI robots: Tailor-made robots, equipped with AI and computer vision technology, meticulously survey store shelves and price labels to detect product shortages and pricing inconsistencies. For instance, Carrefour’s recent integration of Rinf.tech’s specialized shelf-monitoring and price comparison robots in their supermarkets Combating organized retail theft with security robots: Retail stores employ both stationary and mobile robots for security functions, utilizing facial recognition, video recording, and programmed message delivery Ongoing M&A activity and persistent vibrancy in private placements: In the sector, we have observed a total of 20 M&A deals since 2020, indicating a gradual evolution. In contrast, the funding space has been vibrant and had 54 deals since Jan 2022 To provide a deeper understanding of the topic, the report includes key disruptors, industry landscape (segment-wise and geography-wise) and notable M&A transactions activity (including major deals within the last 36 months).

    "extractedText": "Retail Technology Quarterly - Q3 Retail Technology Quarterly : October 2021 After a turbulent end of summer with renewed uncertainty related to the Delta variant of Covid-19, the pandemic continues to reinforce the need for agile and creative ways to keep retail thriving through adversity. In this RTQ, we focus on three trends: Supply Chain Automation; AI Driving the Business; and The Metaverse. Supply Chain Automation Supply Chains are at the crux of all retail, both brick-and-mortar and direct-to-consumer depend on accurate timing and swift delivery. So, when supply chains are experiencing labor shortages it causes prolonged delays, increased expenses, and overall frustrations. Over the past 18 months, retailers have been plagued by supply chain challenges and are looking to technologies to help alleviate some of that stress. Automation technologies can be deployed across distribution centers, factories, and ports to increase efficiencies and manage expenses. Chewy recently announced plans to open three automated fulfillment centers over the next 14 months as a response to labor shortages. RILA’s 2021 Supply Chain Startup Innovation Award winner, SVT Robotics, helps to integrate automated systems with no-code solutions creating an easier entry point for robotic solutions. For more sessions focused on Supply Chain Transformation and technologies, revisit the RIC Stage to see speakers from Microsoft, Intel, RILA, eMarketer, and more. AI Driving the Business While artificial intelligence (AI) is supporting transformation in supply chain automation and transparency (Note Gap’s acquisition of former Startup Network Member CB4); technologies powered by AI can be applied to nearly every aspect of the business. Spending by the retail industry on AI in 2021 has exceeded $11 billion, edging out banking for the top spot according to IDC forecasts. This growth was largely due to the continued rise of eCommerce shopping, demand for greater personalization, improved search, and inventory management. AI is a key player in digital strategies that are creating a high-end experience outside of physical stores. On the consumer side, we see it being used to create augmented “try-on” experiences allowing shoppers to explore collections and receive product recommendations, as well as being used to power social media interactions. Etsy is utilizing AI to create better search graphing, connecting search terms that may not match exactly, but are related to give shoppers better results to browse. AI offers abundant use-cases to create a modern shopping experience, but retailers will have to continue to refine the experience and relationship of AI across channels. The Metaverse Is The Metaverse the next frontier of retail? The term refers to the 3D space in which the digital and physical worlds intertwine. While most industries are in the very early stages of utilizing these technologies, many predict (Check out The Verge’s interview with Mark Zuckerberg and the subsequent name change) it will become a part of regular business. Companies like Gucci and Vans are partnering with the Roblox platform to interact with their customers in new ways, creating products and virtual experiences to explore. Another foray into The Metaverse might be selling NFTs, pieces of digital content linked to the blockchain, which luxury brands like Givenchy are selling. While we’ve only explored The Metaverse here in terms of consumer interaction, leaders on this technology predict it will also become commonplace among the workforce as a new way to host meetings and events. While the technology to make the Metaverse a reality is still in early stages, the hype is picking up steam, especially amongst Gen Z, and is worth keeping an eye on as it continues to develop and intertwine with our daily lives. At RILA’s Retail Innovation Center, we are working to help leading retailers navigate the challenges of transformation by connecting retailers with startups, investors, and technologies that will drive retail in the 21st century.

In retail, 2023 is set to still be a time of challenge and flux as the world recovers from the disruption of the pandemic. Shoppers have limited disposable income, and are selective about where they spend it, meaning retailers have to compete hard to win wallet share. But we’re also seeing exciting technology trends* in the retail industry. There has never been so much tech in retail, with retail technology solutions having the power to help attract and retain customers, for sustained growth and profit. iVend Retail Management SuiteiVend are leaders in innovation in the retail industry. See how we’re implementing digital technology in retail stores. Read moreRetail tech solutions for scalable personalisationShoppers want a fantastic experience.** They don’t want to be ‘one of many’ – they want a personalised approach that makes them feel seen and valued. But the challenge for retailers is how to provide this personalisation at scale, without compromising efficient operation and growth. Retail technology solutions are the answer. Tech in retail is the ‘magic’ that allows personalisation at scale. Here we look at how technology is changing retail, and the key ways that technology trends in the retail industry for 2023 are enabling greater personalisation and customer experience. Five key technology trends in the retail industry for 2023 Visualisation – one of the most exciting of the technology trends in the retail industry is engagement with The Metaverse – using Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) tech in retail to transform the shopping experience. The Metaverse is growing rapidly+ as it becomes an integral part of our everyday life and shopping experiences, and globally the VR market is forecast to reach $15.8 bn (USD) by the end of 2023. Metaverse innovation in the retail industry takes the form of virtual dressing rooms, where shoppers ‘try on’ clothes on a digital avatar of themselves. Or a digital mirror that ‘applies’ makeup to an image of their own face, or a picture of their home, with new furniture items ‘placed’ in the room. Nike uses retail tech solutions with embedded computer vision to scan a shopper’s foot and analyses the image with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to determine the right sized shoe, ensuring the perfect fit for the 60% of people currently purchase the wrong size. Curated collections – retail technology solutions that use AI to learn customers’ preferences are being used to offer curated selections of products, such as those from Stitch Fix. Every time the shopper purchases, the retail tech solution understands more about them and enhances the selection. This digital technology in retail stores provides a ‘personal shopper’ service that enhances the customer’s experience and increases sales. This retail tech trend is driving a predicted growth of the AI in retail market of 23.9% between 2022 and 2030++. Custom designed products – AI-based retail technology solutions enable shoppers to custom design products, such as ‘Nike by You’, where they select the colours and finishes of their own shoe. Retail tech solutions using visualisation offer a truly personalised, but digital and scalable, shopping experience. Deep insights – retailers capture a wealth of data; from apps, eCommerce sites, loyalty programs, point of sale and suppliers. One of the continuing IT trends in the retail industry is ever-smarter data mining, turning this abundance of data into insights that can improve the customer experience and drive operational efficiencies. Automated retail technologies for data mining can predict future customer behaviours and purchasing trends so retailers can ensure they are ready to meet customer demands, whilst also optimising inventory. Delivery options – shoppers want personalisation in the way they receive their purchases. Driverless delivery – by robot and drone – is an innovation in the retail industry that is set to grow in 2023. The delivery robot market is forecast to be $957m by 2026 ¶¶ and drone delivery has a projected global market size of $1.68 bn by the end of the year. Drones and robots offer fast, efficient and cost effective delivery, and this automated retail technology adds the finishing touch to an overall positive customer experience.So as we look ahead to the technology trends in the retail industry, we see an increasing dependence on the Metaverse, AI and automated retail technologies. This level of innovation in the retail industry makes it a very exciting sector place to be in 2023. Why should retail stores invest in retail technology? Retail has always been competitive, and now the economic crisis has limited consumers’ spending power, meaning that there is even greater competition for the shopping dollar. In challenging times, it is those businesses who invest to stay ahead of the curve and position themselves for the future who survive and",

    "extractedText": "Picture this: As you step into a retail store, you're greeted by floating holographic product displays, making each item appear larger than life. Rather than traditional sales assistants, a team of AI-powered robots stand ready to assist you. As you approach a smart mirror enhanced with Augmented Reality (AR) technology, you witness a mesmerizing transformation – the mirror shows you exactly how that chosen dress will look on you. With a simple swipe, you can modify every aspect of the dress: its color, style, and fit.And when you’re done, just scan, pay, and you're on your way. There's no need to queue at checkout counters. Or you could also, using a Virtual Reality (VR) headset, embark on a shopping spree from the comfort of your home, and have your chosen items swiftly delivered by dronesThis scenario, which might seem straight out of a popular science fiction movie, is closer to reality than you might imagine. It's not a distant dream; these technologies are not only real but also advancing at a remarkable pace. In this blog post, we'll delve into these remarkable technologies and explore the trends that revolutionized the retail landscape in 2024.What Is Retail Technology?Retail technology refers to the innovative tools, systems, and practices that retailers employ to enhance customer experiences, streamline operations, and remain competitive in a digital age.Unveiling the Top 8 Retail Technology Trends of 2024Now, let's jump into the exciting world of the retail tech trends of 2024. Each one of these trends is like a glimpse into the future, where stores work smarter and shopping becomes even more enjoyable. Here we go: 1: The Era of Hyper-Personalized Retail Experiences is HereNo matter their age or interests, customers now expect tailored shopping experiences. Forrester research found that 73% of customers aspire to be truly delighted by the companies they shop with. Surprisingly, just 18% feel companies are delivering this level of personalization. In 2024, the retail industry made efforts to bridge this gap, using data, analytics, and technology to offer a highly individualized shopping experience. It meant offering product recommendations, promotions, and content that genuinely resonated with each customer's unique preferences and habits.2: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) Play an Unprecedented RoleA study by McKinsey has estimated that the transformative power of AI could bring in an annual value of $400 billion to $800 billion globally for the retail industry. AI is no longer just a buzzword; it's a game-changer.In 2024, it's being employed in various ways, from predicting customer preferences, writing personalized copies and demand to powering chatbots for instant customer support. What’s more, Machine Learning helps retailers make sense of immense amounts of data, uncovering hidden patterns that drive better decision-making.3: Automation in Retail: The Shift Towards Seamless Operations Automation is the answer to the ongoing labor gaps that are impacting retail. Retailers are increasingly turning to technology to perform repetitive tasks with minimal human intervention. In 2024, this goes well beyond cashierless checkout options. Automation is making a mark in areas like warehousing, inventory management, and order fulfillment.McKinsey reports that 52% of all retail tasks can be automated with existing technology, reducing human errors, enhancing service quality, boosting employee productivity, and saving costs. In a highly competitive market, automation isn't just a choice; it's a necessity.4: Augmented Reality (AR): Taking the Shopping Experience to the Next Level While Augmented Reality (AR) has been around for some time in retail, its importance has surged post-pandemic. AR allows consumers to enjoy interactive experiences by adding computer-generated digital content to real-world objects. It's all about blending the virtual and physical shopping experience. Imagine the scenario mentioned earlier: You're shopping for sneakers online, and you want to see how they look on your feet. With AR, you can simply point your smartphone's camera at your feet and get a real-time view of how the shoes will appear. Virtual try-on apps and virtual fitting software have been particularly successful, especially in the fashion and makeup sectors. They bridge the gap between online and physical shopping, enhancing the customer experience.For example, Sephora allows customers to try on makeup in-store or via their AR-driven Virtual Artist App.5: Social Commerce: Marriage of Social Media and RetailSocial media is not just a place to share pictures; it's a potent selling tool. In 2024, social commerce is a crucial part of the omnichannel retail experience. According to a survey by Campaign Monitor, 33% of Gen Z were persuaded to buy something after seeing it on social media. It's not just about ads; social commerce goes hand-in-hand with the rise of livestream shopping, where consumers ca",

Posted on January 9, 2024 | by Jeff Ketner AI’s breakthrough year in 2023 was the retail technology equivalent of Taylor Swift’s Eras tour – a once-in-a-generation event that changes everything. If Swiftmania is the biggest musical sensation since The Beatles, then Generative AI is easily the most revolutionary technology since the iPhone. AI is quickly becoming a pervasive technology, dividing the timeline for tech advancements into “before” and “after” AI. AI will dominate the 2024 retail tech industry Dan Berthiume, senior technology editor of Chain Store Age, summed up the impact of AI in a recent Q&A with Ketner Group: “AI is the most dominant technology I’ve seen in the last 15 years. It will be an important component in every technology system and every part of the enterprise, and like mobile and omnichannel commerce, it will be a constant feature (not just in retail) and will just be assumed.” It’s a safe bet that AI will be the #1 tech topic at next week’s NRF 2024. And while AI will continue to dominate the retail technology landscape 2024, the conversations have shifted from the technology itself to all the different ways that AI impacts retail: from product creation to assortment planning, forecasting, supply chain management, pricing, PIM, marketing and every other area of the complex retail ecosystem. Along the way, we’re also starting to see some data emerge about the financial impact of AI in retail. Last month our friends at IHL Group released their Retail AI Readiness Profiles that measure the potential financial impact that AI can bring to retailers and restaurant chains. As always, IHL quantified its findings with an impressive real-world analogy: according to IHL, Macy’s alone could see $7.5B in business gains from AI in the next 5 years. What are some of the AI-driven tech trends to watch for in 2024? Here are just a few of the things we’re tracking; they’re just a small sampling of all the ways that AI will impact retail in 2024. Personalization continues to get more personal Retail is moving from personalization to hyper-personalization, delivering shopping experiences that “dazzle each shopper at scale,” according to Adobe’s annual research report, 2023 Digital Trends: Retail in Focus. Currently, only 16% of retailers can personalize experiences based on customers’ interaction history, while only 9% provide personalized experiences based on shopper intent. There’s massive room for improvement, and AI is the critical technology that makes this possible. AI helps combat retail’s labor shortage Employee turnover in retail reached record highs in 2023, but a combination of AI, robotics, computer vision and other technologies can help retailers offset the impact of labor shortages by automating routine tasks. For example, autonomous inventory robots can provide 24×7 inventory updates and help retailers keep their shelves stocked, reducing out-of-stocks and increasing sales. Retail supply chains become more resilient with AI One of the biggest technology lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic was that retail supply chains weren’t resilient enough to handle sudden supply chain shocks, from factory closings to rapid changes in consumer demand and the need for new fulfillment models. AI is quickly helping change that. A recent Business Insider article notes, “Robots are helping fulfillment-center workers sort through large volumes of products, artificial intelligence is predicting the most energy-efficient delivery routes, and modern data-collection and analysis methods are helping retail stores optimize stock management. Retail-technology experts say that without these innovations, supply chains would struggle to function in the face of fast-changing customer expectations and turbulent economic times.” Retail tech spending will increase in 2024 The examples above are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to AI innovation in retail. And given the furious pace of AI innovation, it’s no surprise that Gartner predicts that 57% of retailers plan to spend more on software in 2024. AI will certainly be a major driver in this trend, especially as retailers look at AI’s tremendous financial upside (IHL estimates that the overall economic impact for the top 212 North American retailers and restaurants will be $1.5 trillion for the next 5 years). Ketner Group is fortunate to have a number of clients that are on the forefront of AI innovation, and we’re looking forward to exciting press announcements at next week’s NRF Show. 2024 will be a pivotal year for AI in retail technology, and Ketner Group clients will be a big part of the story!

    "extractedText": "Online and nonstore sales growth picked up the pace in October, according to both advance estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau and the National Retail Federation’s Retail Monitor and CNBC. CNBC and NRF’s Retail Monitor exclude automobile and gasoline from their calculation of total retail sales. Additionally, they identify a calculation for “core” retail sales, which exclude restaurants in addition to automobile dealers and gas stations. “Inflation is mostly limited to services at this point and prices for some retail goods are actually falling,” said Matthew Shay, NRF president and CEO, in a statement. “October sales have set the stage for a good start to the holiday shopping season.” Total retail sales in October 2024 Based on Census Bureau data, total retail sales reached $718.9 billion in October 2024. That’s up 0.4% compared to September 2024, and it’s also up 2.8% compared to October 2023. Although that month-over-month growth rate is stagnant compared to September 2024’s growth over August 2024, the increased year-over-year growth indicates deeper sales gains. NRF did not release a total sales figure. Advance estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau differ slightly, in part because of the Retail Monitor’s exclusions. NRF data shows total retail sales increased 0.74% compared to September 2024 as well as 4.13% compared to October 2023. In September, total retail sales had decreased month over month (0.32%) and increased year over year (0.55%). Similar to October 2024 total retail sales, core retail sales increased 0.83% compared to September 2024 and 4.59% compared to October 2023. In September, core retail sales had shrunk month over month (0.28%) and grown year over year (0.94%). Until that drop in September, there had been seven consecutive months of gains, Shay had said in a statement at the time. Online and nonstore sales in October 2024 Census Bureau data indicates nonstore retailers grew 7% year over year in October. At the same time, Retail Monitor data indicates online and other non-store sales in October 2024 grew 1.84% over September 2024, as well as 19.38% over October 2023. Both month over month and year over year, the growth rate of online and nonstore sales in October outpaced each of the other categories the Retail Monitor tracks. NRF says the Retail Monitor uses actual, anonymized credit and debit card purchase data compiled by Affinity Solutions and does not need to be revised monthly or annually. Sales grew month over month in most categories October 2024 online and other nonstore sales (grew 1.84% month over month) Health and personal care stores (up 1.45%) General merchandise stores (up 0.05%) Grocery and beverage stores (up 0.87%) Building and garden supply stores (up 1.69%) Furniture and home furnishings stores (up 0.58%) Sporting goods, hobby, music and book stores (up 2.7%) Clothing and accessories stores (decreased 0.57%) Electronics and appliance stores (down 0.81%) Sales grew year over year in most categories October 2024 online and other nonstore sales (up 19.38% year over year) Clothing and accessories stores (up 8.56%) Health and personal care stores (up 8.35%) General merchandise stores (up 5.51%) Grocery and beverage stores (up 3.76%) Building and garden supply stores (up 3.12%) Furniture and home furnishings stores (up 1.87%) Electronics and appliance stores (decreased 0.64%) Sporting goods, hobby, music and book stores (down 1.23%) Click here to read last month’s update on U.S. online sales.

This figure is expected to increase by 50% over the next four years, reaching around $7.4 trillion by 2025. More than ever, owners are creating and improving their ecommerce platforms, and competition is heating up.Ecommerce trends for 2023Mobile commerceRise of the MarketplacesCustomizationArtificial intelligenceAugmented realityMore ways to paySustainability and remarketingOmnichannel customer experienceSocial commerceLive shoppingTop ecommerce trends for 2023There are several ecommerce trends to watch out for in the coming year. Here is a brief overview of the trends we should be paying attention to:1. Mobile commerceEnabling customers to shop via mobile devices is no longer an exception but a new norm. According to statistics, mobile devices account for 61% of retail traffic, with 70 million online users shopping via mobile devices. This figure will definitely increase, so we are convinced that mobile commerce will be one of the major e-commerce development trends shaping the future.The reason is simple and clear: mobile shopping is convenient. It allows customers to shop from anywhere, which is essential in today's world. Customers can simply research, compare products and make payments on the go.2. Rise of the \"MarketplacesMarketplaces provide a simple paradigm for multiple vendors to collaborate on a single system to handle everything, making it easier to reach specific groups of people and address specific problems. This model will become more popular in the coming years. According to Forbes, marketplace sales will exceed $3.5 trillion by 2024.3. CustomizationPersonalization will undoubtedly play a key role in the development of personalized e-commerce in the near future. According to statistics, more than 60% of consumers are more likely to become repeat buyers if a company offers a personalized shopping experience. Consequently, we can expect an even more significant shift towards personalization, especially in relation to search experiences.On-site search personalization refers to tailoring search results for each particular customer according to their previous behavior on your site, profile data and many other aspects. Using search engines such as Elasticsearch or Algolia, for example, you can make suggestions about what search results your customers expect to see as they type their search queries.43% of customers use site search when making a purchase, so investing in this can be a crucial source of making information accessible throughout your site and retaining more customers.4. Artificial Intelligence (AI)Most cutting-edge technologies, such as intelligent chatbots, personalized product recommendation engines and voice search, use artificial intelligence (AI), and will become essential to the e-commerce industry in the coming years. With 70% of online business owners believing that AI for e-commerce will help them personalize their online stores, there is no doubt that this technology will continue to grow.Voice-activated payments, virtual conversations and voice searches are the most common uses. In addition, machine vision enables face detection and identification. During a purchase process, chatbots employ deep learning algorithms and NLP (Natural Language Processing) to capture the human speech and words of the other party.5. Augmented Reality (AR)Augmented reality (AR) is a real game changer in e-commerce. Statista estimates that the augmented reality industry is worth $30.7 billion, with more than 400,000 AR glasses sold by 2021.This technology uses 3D mapping to allow customers to try things on or preview experiences before they buy. What challenges does AR commerce solve? It enables you to offer a more intuitive and engaging visual shopping experience that allows customers to interact with products in an immersive way. As a result, AR technology enhances customers' ability to visualize products before they buy and make more successful purchases.That's why we expect many more companies to use AR for their products and services, especially in specific industries, such as fashion and home décor, because the customer can get a better idea of the item without seeing it in person.6. More ways to pay69.8% of shoppers abandon at some point between filling their cart and checking out. Let's face it, typing in a credit card number isn't the most user-friendly experience. That's why offering more methods to receive online payments may soon be in demand.If customers can't pay the way they want to on an e-commerce website, there's a good chance they'll cancel a potential sale. Offering a range of payment options is an excellent approach to boost conversion rates. Plus, if customers can save their payment information on your website (and this process is protected), they will be able to pay faster the next time they make a purchase.Consumers ar",
