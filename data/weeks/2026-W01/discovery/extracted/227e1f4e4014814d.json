This honor recognizes the unique impact Focal has had in reimagining store operations and shelf management across the industry. Driving real‑time shelf intelligence Self‑Driving Store Operating System: Our plug‑and‑play camera network scans shelves hourly to spot low stock, out‑of‑stock items, and planogram issues—automating decisions that once relied on manual checks. Scalable impact: In 2022 alone Focal grew from 40,000 to over 200,000 cameras in market. Major retail partners: Leading grocers like Fairway, ShopRite—and as of last year, Walmart—leverage Focal’s data to cut food waste in half, boost profits, and boost associate morale by freeing them for higher‑value tasks. Why Fast Company took noticeFast Company’s annual Most Innovative Companies list celebrates organizations reshaping how we work, shop, and live. In the Retail category, Focal stood out for: Efficiency gains at scale. Automating inventory checks not only slashes labor costs but dramatically reduces spoilage and stockouts.
