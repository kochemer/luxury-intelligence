This figure is expected to increase by 50% over the next four years, reaching around $7.4 trillion by 2025. More than ever, owners are creating and improving their ecommerce platforms, and competition is heating up.Ecommerce trends for 2023Mobile commerceRise of the MarketplacesCustomizationArtificial intelligenceAugmented realityMore ways to paySustainability and remarketingOmnichannel customer experienceSocial commerceLive shoppingTop ecommerce trends for 2023There are several ecommerce trends to watch out for in the coming year. Here is a brief overview of the trends we should be paying attention to:1. Mobile commerceEnabling customers to shop via mobile devices is no longer an exception but a new norm. According to statistics, mobile devices account for 61% of retail traffic, with 70 million online users shopping via mobile devices. This figure will definitely increase, so we are convinced that mobile commerce will be one of the major e-commerce development trends shaping the future.The reason is simple and clear: mobile shopping is convenient. It allows customers to shop from anywhere, which is essential in today's world. Customers can simply research, compare products and make payments on the go.2. Rise of the \"MarketplacesMarketplaces provide a simple paradigm for multiple vendors to collaborate on a single system to handle everything, making it easier to reach specific groups of people and address specific problems. This model will become more popular in the coming years. According to Forbes, marketplace sales will exceed $3.5 trillion by 2024.3. CustomizationPersonalization will undoubtedly play a key role in the development of personalized e-commerce in the near future. According to statistics, more than 60% of consumers are more likely to become repeat buyers if a company offers a personalized shopping experience. Consequently, we can expect an even more significant shift towards personalization, especially in relation to search experiences.On-site search personalization refers to tailoring search results for each particular customer according to their previous behavior on your site, profile data and many other aspects. Using search engines such as Elasticsearch or Algolia, for example, you can make suggestions about what search results your customers expect to see as they type their search queries.43% of customers use site search when making a purchase, so investing in this can be a crucial source of making information accessible throughout your site and retaining more customers.4. Artificial Intelligence (AI)Most cutting-edge technologies, such as intelligent chatbots, personalized product recommendation engines and voice search, use artificial intelligence (AI), and will become essential to the e-commerce industry in the coming years. With 70% of online business owners believing that AI for e-commerce will help them personalize their online stores, there is no doubt that this technology will continue to grow.Voice-activated payments, virtual conversations and voice searches are the most common uses. In addition, machine vision enables face detection and identification. During a purchase process, chatbots employ deep learning algorithms and NLP (Natural Language Processing) to capture the human speech and words of the other party.5. Augmented Reality (AR)Augmented reality (AR) is a real game changer in e-commerce. Statista estimates that the augmented reality industry is worth $30.7 billion, with more than 400,000 AR glasses sold by 2021.This technology uses 3D mapping to allow customers to try things on or preview experiences before they buy. What challenges does AR commerce solve? It enables you to offer a more intuitive and engaging visual shopping experience that allows customers to interact with products in an immersive way. As a result, AR technology enhances customers' ability to visualize products before they buy and make more successful purchases.That's why we expect many more companies to use AR for their products and services, especially in specific industries, such as fashion and home décor, because the customer can get a better idea of the item without seeing it in person.6. More ways to pay69.8% of shoppers abandon at some point between filling their cart and checking out. Let's face it, typing in a credit card number isn't the most user-friendly experience. That's why offering more methods to receive online payments may soon be in demand.If customers can't pay the way they want to on an e-commerce website, there's a good chance they'll cancel a potential sale. Offering a range of payment options is an excellent approach to boost conversion rates. Plus, if customers can save their payment information on your website (and this process is protected), they will be able to pay faster the next time they make a purchase.Consumers ar",
